<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 30 April, the Commission decided on the preliminary draft of the Budget for 2003. I am glad to be able to present the rough outline of it to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by setting out in general terms the 2003 Budget's basic figures, which we had the opportunity of briefly discussing in the Committee on Budgets yesterday evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's preliminary draft Budget amounts to EUR 98.2 billion, representing an increase of 2.7% over the current Budget. Compared with those predicted for the Member States' public budgets, this rate of increase is lower than the average. I want above all to emphasise that the preliminary draft Budget is, with EUR 4.7 billion, below the amount that the Agenda 2000 financial perspective fixed as a maximum. I also see it as good news that a preliminary draft Budget, despite the many new demands that are made on it, can be set out in such a way that there remains a large margin for unforeseen eventualities, and that this can also be captured within the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Budget amounts to 1.03% as a proportion of gross domestic income, which means that the share of European GDP attributable to public expenditure for next year is 1.03%. That is very small – less, indeed, than in previous years. The reason I lay such emphasis on this is that it demonstrates that Budget discipline is taken very seriously even at European level. I also emphasise it because it is often said in public discussions that, okay, there will be these developments and those developments, and they will exceed what is budgeted for. On the contrary, that is not the case; rather, we again have a preliminary draft Budget below what was laid down as an upper limit in the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we should also make clear what will be financed within the European Budget with this share of GDP attributable to public expenditure that amounts to just over one per cent of the EU's economic performance, and which policy areas will benefit from this money from the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take agriculture first, which continues to be the most significant area. If we add all the agricultural policy outgoings together, they amount to a total of EUR 48.7 billion allocated to this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This figure includes, for example, aid for the candidate countries, that is, for the farmers in the candidate countries, and also the staff in the Directorate-General which has responsibility for this area. To put it another way, if we express it as a percentage of the EU's gross national income, just about 0.5% of the EU's gross national income is to be spent on agriculture via the European Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The illustration I have just given with reference to agriculture corresponds to the new approach to breaking down the Budget by policy areas. In the past it was very often the case that the public had difficulty reading the Budget – if they had any access to it at all – because it listed only the Budget lines, but not the legal bases, which one might term the policy content, what was to be achieved with the money. With the new Budget breakdown, that has now been done, and it is clear at a glance how much is to be used and for which policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">To quote a few more figures before I move on to something else, EUR 21.8 billion have been allocated to regional policy, EUR 940 million to fisheries policy, EUR 3.2 billion for external relations, EUR 1.1 billion to development policy, EUR 9.8 billion for employment and social affairs, and EUR 1 billion solely for promoting the information society. Such a breakdown is in fact capable of expressing much more than would be possible through a breakdown of figures only by reference to categories in the financial perspective. All the same, I propose now to enlarge on these categories.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already referred to agriculture, in which area there is, according to the Commission proposal, a margin of EUR 2.3 billion, meaning that the Commission's preliminary draft remains EUR 2.3 billion under the maximum set for agriculture in the financial perspective. This positive outcome results from a combination of several factors: firstly the prognosis of relatively favourable market developments in agriculture, then a situation in which stocks are relatively low, and an underlying euro/dollar exchange rate of EUR 1 to USD 0.88. At this point, I must observe that this is not the Commission's prediction for the future development of the euro/dollar exchange rate, but regulations state that, when drawing up the preliminary draft Budget, we have to base our calculations on the average over the preceding months. However, I will point out that, in the event of the euro/dollar exchange rate changing, or, to put it another way, the euro rising, expenditure in the agricultural sector will also rise. That does not, though, represent a risk to the Budget, as the large margin will remain and will be able to take it up.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, the Commission will be presenting its so-called mid-term-Review of agriculture. My fellow-Commissioner Fischler will then present an overview estimating how agricultural expenditure will develop in the future, and proposals for reforms. These will not, however, have any direct effect on the 2003 Budget year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to observe that our agricultural policy will have different rates of increase. Firstly, that used for rural development is, as in previous years, and in accordance with the Commission proposal, to be the whole amount provided for in the financial perspective; this instrument will play a very major role in the future and it is certain to receive special attention in the mid-term review of agricultural reform, as incentives need to be used to promote alternative economic opportunities in rural areas. Above all, this category includes environmental measures of relevance to agricultural policy and this makes it highly significant in terms of sustainable agricultural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on market measures and direct aids for agricultural policy, I would like to point out that 2003 will be the first year in which the new organisation of the agricultural markets in goats and sheep will apply. This gives us a slight increase in this area, because, according to the resolutions adopted so far, for example, a premium of EUR 21 per head per annum is paid for sheep. This is an increase over the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to structural policy, where the commitment appropriations for structural measures are in line with the current financial perspective, although here the Budget ceiling is exceeded to a negligible degree, as the Commission, adhering to the resolutions passed by Parliament and the Council, is looking to present the second tranche, of EUR 27 million, for the special measures to restructure the fishing fleet in Spain and Portugal. The Commission proposes that this should be funded out of the flexibility reserve, and I believe this is in accord with the arrangement reached as part of last year's resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past two years, estimating the payment appropriations required for the structural policy as a whole was made very difficult by the programmes' start-up phase, so that there was under-utilisation in these areas in 2000 and 2001. Some of the resources were able to be transferred to other programmes. It is due to this delay in implementation that we now have, of course, a sharp increase in the payment appropriations we must reckon with, and the Commission's preliminary draft Budget envisages a 4.4% increase in the structural policy's payment appropriations. It is to be noted that a major part of this is intended to pay the balance for the old programmes carried out by the Member States between 1994 and 1999. Delays occurred in all the Member States, with consequent delays to the final payments, but we hope that all of these can be dealt with in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to category 3, the internal policy measures, which are indeed wide-ranging. It is proposed that funds amounting to EUR 6.7 billion be allocated, leaving a reserve of EUR 81 million, which is sure to be called on in the course of the discussions on the Budget. Let me also point out that a very large number of new measures have been adopted. Your House has just had a debate on the new Sixth Framework Programme; I am glad that a decision can now be taken on it and that, as I have just heard, the Framework Programme can be voted on tomorrow. It is endowed with an overall EUR 17.5 billion up to 2006. That this is a very large amount of money should be reiterated, as the accusation is frequently levelled that the European Budget, with its particular focus on agricultural policy, would never promote new developments. I believe that the Framework Programme demonstrates that the opposite is the case, in that a truly massive amount is being invested in joint promotion of research, and preparations for the programme's implementation can be set in train as soon as the decision is taken. The preliminary draft of the Budget already allocates over EUR 4 billion to this research programme for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to quote, as another example of new measures, the transport sector, in which it is envisaged that EUR 53 million will be spent on maintaining safety measures, so that 2003 will be marked by the establishment of the European Aviation Safety Agency and the European Agency for Safe Seas. This is something else that the public can expect of the European Union – action being taken to prevent accidents of the sort we have experienced in the past, and to ensure, moreover, that the steps that are taken are effective without delay. That will be another of the tasks for the Agency for Safe Seas.</p>
<p class="contents">Resources for the new so-called Marco Polo programme have also to be incorporated. These are Community financial aid to improve the impact on the environment of freight transport networks. As one final example of category 3, I will point out that measures for a rational energy policy, in the form of the promotion of innovative sources of energy, show, with almost 50%, the greatest increase. I believe this is another example of how the priority given to the promotion of sustainable development results in corresponding approaches to funding.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to discuss the area of external policy, that is, category 4, where commitment appropriations totalling EUR 4.9 billion are envisaged, representing an increase of 2.3% over the current Budget year. In its draft, the Commission is standing by its priorities and the foreign policy commitments we have made. Let me mention the Balkans, to which, for next year, we are allocating EUR 685 million. Aid for Afghanistan is also in accordance with commitments which the Commission made on behalf of the European Union in December 2001 in Tokyo. Funds for this have also been budgeted for, although it will of course be necessary to exert proper financial control on all these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, furthermore, to emphasise that an increase of 4.2% is planned in the financing of the Mediterranean programme, which includes pre-accession aid<span class="italic"> </span>for Turkey, Malta and Cyprus, but also new resources for the commitment made as part of the Barcelona process to make available additional resources from the European Investment Bank, constituting the provision of a special facility. The Commission proposes to set aside EUR 25 million for this purpose, for example, to give financial support to a risk capital programme.</p>
<p class="contents">One external affairs policy focus for the Commission is the combating of serious infectious diseases in many parts of the world. In consequence, the appropriations for health measures in 2003, have, on the Commission's proposal, had around EUR 55 million added to them, EUR 35 million of which is an additional contribution to the Global Health Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Still in the external policy field, I would like above all to mention that the Commission proposes to allocate EUR 40 million to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, EUR 20 million of which would be set aside for the joint European peace mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This makes it clear that this new type of activity under the Common Foreign and Security Policy is funded out of the operational part of the Community Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in conclusion, turn to the administrative costs, where the appropriations come up against something of a peculiar situation. On the one hand, there is here a very large increase in pensions payments, but, on the other, we made no provision in the financial perspective for the European Community institutions – both Parliament and the Commission, the European Court of Justice and the Council – to have to take preparatory steps in the run-up to enlargement. It is for this reason that the Commission's preliminary draft Budget exceeds the upper limit only in respect of these preparatory measures. The Commission proposes that the resources needed for this should be made available from the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">For myself, I am sure that this will be one of the main points to be covered in discussion, including with the Council, which has held out the prospect of an increase of 11% for its staff appropriations. That is not the increase for which the Commission is planning, but I do believe that it is this very area that we have to debate together, in very definite terms, how to go about the preparatory measures that are necessary if enlargement is to be a success for the institutions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I take it as read that this will be a keynote in the debates, as much of course as the issue of how to fund any new requirements in the area of foreign policy, such as – and I will give just two examples – Palestine and Cyprus. I hope that the conciliation meeting in July will enable us to find a common outlook. The Commission was unanimous in deciding on the preliminary draft Budget after a very matter-of-fact discussion, and the unanimity was due, among other things, to the preliminary draft Budget again being so well prepared by the Directorate-General and above all by its Director-General, Mr Mingasson. As it is, so to speak, the last draft prepared by him in his capacity as Director-General of the Budget Directorate-General, I would like to take this opportunity to thank him warmly for the work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted by this burst of applause for Mr Mingasson. Thank you very much!</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussion of the priorities has shown that Parliament's and the Commission's are very largely the same after all, something that is also shown in the preliminary draft Budget. I believe it to be a successful draft that looks to fund new requirements and is, at the same time, guided by budgetary discipline. I look forward, of course, to the debates, and am highly optimistic that we will be able to achieve a good outcome this year as well.</p>

He has asked me to speak on his behalf too.</p>
<p class="contents">We both wish to express our thanks to Commissioner Schreyer and Director-General Gazon for their excellent cooperation. I believe that we shall benefit greatly from the spirit of cooperation we have enjoyed during the year, for there are a number of problems which need to be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">That is only an initial discussion of the preliminary draft budget. We shall be returning to the subject more than once, for example during the July part-session and on a number of occasions this autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nonetheless important to make some introductory observations. First of all, there are a number of positive features I think there is good reason for looking at.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, concerning the draft budget for the year, is the improvement of the process itself. We are now finally on the way towards a system of activity-based budgeting and thus also towards a more lucid and transparent system that will make it easier to present the EU budget to people in Europe, something which I think is incredibly important if people are to have confidence in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now taking the first step by using the old technique and the new ADB technique in parallel, something which constitutes major progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The second positive feature is that we have succeeded in achieving a better political dialogue. Through the Commission’s annual political strategy and through the fact that the Council and Parliament decide upon the political guidelines for next year’s budget at approximately the same time, we have brought about a political exchange, or dialogue, at an earlier stage. That is, in fact, progress. Certainly, there was a great deal of criticism in Parliament of the lack of factual content in the Commission’s annual political strategy, but I nonetheless believe that the method as such constitutes clear progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that we shall be able to renew Parliament’s own budget debate by holding a wider debate in July in which we do not only focus upon next year’s budget but also upon the implementation of the current year’s budget, as well as linking the processes together, which is something I believe is very important for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want us to be able to have a proper and exciting budget debate this autumn, hopefully during the September part-session, in which we can also make a better link between the budget and the political initiatives in terms of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the procedure itself, which represents a positive development. Another positive aspect is the fact that there is broad agreement as to the basic political priorities. If the Commission’s basic priorities are compared with the guidelines adopted by Parliament, it can be seen that we are agreed on a range of points.</p>
<p class="contents">We are agreed that we must now put enlargement first. Enlargement, which is the most extensive we have ever undertaken, will most probably involve ten countries at the beginning of 2004. That is our most important task, and we must begin preparing for it as early as in the 2003 Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also agreed that we must tackle the issues of security and safety in the broad senses of those words, partly by having a full discussion of how we are to manage security in Europe following the terrorist attacks of last September and partly through adopting a broader perspective on the safety issues – such as food safety and transport safety – on which a range of initiatives need to be taken no later than in next year’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also agreed upon a third area, namely the need for increased focus on sustainable development in economic, social and environmental terms, which is something that will require a range of initiatives on the part of the EU. We have been relatively ineffectual in this area so far, especially when it comes to implementing Parliament’s initiatives on the issues of small companies, <span class="italic">e</span>-learning and a range of other areas within which I believe we must really step up the pace.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind all those who believe that the EU budget is forever growing out of all proportion, it may also be noted, especially for educational purposes, that we now have a budget whose share of the Member States’ economies is decreasing.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though a number of basically positive signs can therefore be seen, a number of points should be noted that cause us to feel a certain anxiety. The first of these, and the one that overshadows everything else, involves the implementation of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a backlog of payments and other backlogs – what are termed <span class="italic">reste à liquider</span> or total outstanding commitments – which only increase. As a reminder, I might mention the debate in the last part-session on supplementary budget number two for 2002 and the fact that the Member States are demanding EUR 10 billion back on the grounds that the EU has not been able to complete its tasks. In this connection, the Commission proposes a greater increase in payments than in new commitments, something which is naturally a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are nonetheless afraid that this measure is quite inadequate for getting to grips with the existing backlogs. Especially on the issue of the structural funds, from which we have to pay the money sooner or later, we are in danger of accumulating a mountain of unpaid budget items which will create major problems in the years to come, especially if these payments have to be made at the same time as we have major costs in connection with enlargement. The problem is of crucial importance and it needs to be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem, which is also worrying and needs to be discussed, is the way in which enlargement is to be dealt with. Of most concern are the efforts which need to be made within the European institutions in order to prepare for enlargement itself. The costs of enlargement as such will not of course place a burden upon the 2003 Budget, but we must prepare ourselves right now, especially if ten new countries are to join as early as the beginning of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the Commission proposes that we use the flexibility instrument to defray the increased administrative expenses. It is possible that we shall be forced to do this, but I believe we must increase the pressure on the Secretary-Generals to produce new, radical proposals, for example concerning increased cooperation between the institutions so as to reduce the costs and thus avoid having recourse to the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are many new avenues open when it comes, for example, to the language regulations and the recruitment of new staff to the EU. We should seriously increase the pressure before we decide to use the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the security and safety issues – I earlier mentioned food and transport safety – we are also concerned about the incredible variety of new authorities or ‘bodies’. We have Eurojust, Europol and authorities for food, rail and air safety and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">These bodies do not in themselves present any problems, but they create problems in terms of budgeting and the ability to obtain an overview of the EU’s costs. They constitute a risk of our doubling our costs due to work’s being carried out in both the Commission and new authorities. They give rise to problems concerning methods of requiring accountability and maintaining scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">We must review these aspects in depth before we continue to extend the variety of new authorities, even though the tasks as such are certainly of exceptional importance.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point we need to discuss, and which the Commissioner too mentioned, is, naturally, foreign policy, for which the Commission proposes a budget margin of EUR 60 million.</p>
<p class="contents">It may sound a lot, but it is actually insufficient. We are faced with major situations of uncertainty, for example the continued development in the Middle East. We do not know what demands will be made upon the EU in terms of efforts in Palestine. We do not know in detail or with any certainty what demands will be made when it comes to Afghanistan or overall efforts at tackling poverty-related illnesses and so on. Nor do we know whether it will be acceptable to reduce our contributions within the CARDS programme in the Balkans at as fast a rate as the Commission is now proposing. In this area too, I believe we need a more extensive discussion and evaluation of the EU’s contributions before we take any decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">To all these uncertain factors, we can add the fisheries agreements within category 4 which, for a further year, will constitute an issue that we need to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to say something about the longer term future. Two of the absolutely most important budget problems we need to discuss certainly do not concern the 2003 Budget, but must nonetheless be addressed. These are the reform of agricultural and fisheries policy, on the one hand, and the real costs of enlargement, on the other. We shall later be receiving a special report on the subject from the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin this discussion in time. Let us also try to retain the extraordinarily interesting cooperation and the common approach we have in relation to the exciting developments towards enlargement. I believe there would then in actual fact be high hopes of being able to find common solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
