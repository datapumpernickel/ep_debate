<p class="contents">I think, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s report bears this out, that short sea shipping is an issue on which there is broad agreement between Parliament, the Member States and the Commission. We all know that short sea shipping is an excellent method of transport that, even so, could be developed further. It is the only method of transport, other than rail, able to confront the growth in road transport. It is therefore necessary to increase funding to the short sea shipping industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to certain key aspects of your report, Mr Navarro. We certainly do need an integrated approach if we are going to make short sea shipping a real door-to-door solution. The new definition set out in the recitals to the report could inspire this integration and contribute to it. The intermodal dimension of this new definition could be used to supplement the modal definition set out in 1999 and commonly accepted across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a great deal of work has been done to overcome the obstacles that prevent the growth of short sea shipping. I would like to mention the Directive on the standard IMO-FAL forms for ships arriving in and departing from ports, based on the International Maritime Organisation’s Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic. This directive means that the number of different forms in force in Europe has fallen from more than 50 to just five.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also raised the issue of customs several times. The current move towards a one-stop shop for administrative formalities and electronic communications will further facilitate short sea shipping. The efficiency of ports is, of course, crucial for short sea shipping, and the adoption of a new proposal for a directive on access to the market of port services should help us, although I have taken note of Parliament’s concern to pay careful attention to the way in which we finalise this text.</p>
<p class="contents">One effective way of promoting the intermodal image of short sea shipping lies in the business-oriented work of short sea promotion centres. These national centres are running a campaign promoting this mode of transport, a campaign which is of course neutral in commercial terms. There are currently 17 of these centres operating within Europe to pass on our policies, and Mr Navarro was quite right to draw attention to all these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The motorways of the sea are a special form – I would call them a brand – of short sea shipping. They combine higher quality with an increase in quantity. By linking ports forming part of trans-European transport networks, they will be able to bypass land bottlenecks and improve cohesion. I would like to pay particular attention to this initiative so that the legal text can become a reality and be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marco Polo programme, and in particular the future Marco Polo II programme, will have a crucial part to play in implementing the motorways of the sea and will be able to provide additional financial resources to eligible projects. Considerable efforts are currently being made to make short sea shipping a success. Nevertheless, we will have to redouble our efforts to achieve better results in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for the work they have done. I am convinced that, together, we will continue to make sure that short sea shipping can grow. I am sure that it will bring a great deal to the whole freight transport policy, which remains an essential part of our great single European market.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore thank you, Mr Navarro, and I am now keen, Mr President, to hear the comments that will follow the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before setting out the main points, I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and my political group, the PSE, for giving me the task of working on the very important subject of short sea shipping and motorways of the sea. I would particularly like to thank the administrators of the European Parliament, Mr Darmis and Mr Préat, and my parliamentary assistants, Mr Caballé and Mr Polack. They have supported me throughout the process of consultation, analysis and drafting leading to this report. Finally, I would like to express my thanks to the services of the Commission’s Energy and Transport DG and to the main professional players working in the sectors concerned, in particular the ship-owners, logistics experts and ports that played an active role in our consultations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to express my surprise at the lack of human and financial resources available to MEPs for investigations. The European Parliament, with the continual growth of its budgetary and legislative powers, has become the voice of the citizens within the European Union. I was therefore surprised to discover that an MEP, as a rapporteur, cannot organise observation missions financed by the European Parliament other than the official missions of the parliamentary committees, which take place only once or twice a year. As you know, the devil is in the detail and, if the European Parliament is going to be effective in its supervisory role, it will in future need to benefit from increased levels of in-house expertise, in particular so that the independence and impartiality of its Members can be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, let me remind you of the context surrounding the issue of the development of maritime transport in Europe. In its White Paper on European transport policy for 2010, published in 2001, the European Commission highlighted the important role to be played by short sea shipping in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and stressed the need to simplify the regulatory framework. It introduced the concept of motorways of the sea, pointing to the need to promote mass rapid maritime transport links providing a way around the bottlenecks posed, for example, by the Alps and Pyrenees. The European Parliament supported these proposals for short sea shipping in its report on the White Paper, adopted on 2 January 2003. The rapporteur for that report was Mr Izquierdo Collado. The Commission’s most recent communication, which was published in 2004 and which we discussed, is primarily a mid-term document; its aim is to review the situation in short sea shipping, the obstacles it encounters and the actions taken to resolve them.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention of my report is firstly to provide you with an overview of short sea shipping in Europe. I would like to draw your attention to two main facts. Firstly, short sea shipping’s share of all intra-European transport rose by 25% between 1995 and 2002 and now accounts for 40% of all goods transported within Europe, as against 45% for road transport. Secondly, recent data regarding the environmental impact of short sea shipping show that it has a much smaller negative impact than road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion to be drawn from this overview is clear. Our task is to promote short sea shipping, in order to reconcile protection of the environment, quality of life and economic growth. However, there are a number of obstacles to the growth of short sea shipping. I do not want exhaustively to list here all the obstacles that I stressed in my report, but I would like to point out to you two main issues. Firstly, this report stresses the lack of a real interventionist policy aimed at attracting and guiding the major road transport organisers and operators to short sea shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our meetings with managers within the sector have convinced us of the urgent need to set up clear, effective, adequate funding mechanisms for the actions that need to be taken. The various existing sources of funding should enable optimum complementarity, making it possible to launch durable new lines.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these obstacles, my report lays particular emphasis on the need to settle the issue of the standardisation of intermodal loading units and to facilitate the integration of short sea shipping into the supply chain. We also suggest relaunching the Community debate on the unification of the legal system for the multimodal chain. This report was approved unanimously by the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Our consultation work enabled us to reach compromises on crucial points. The report emphasises the potential for increasing the use of short sea shipping for passenger transport, the opportunities to create thousands of jobs, the importance of links between short sea shipping and inland waterways, the importance of short sea shipping for islands, compliance with Community competition rules and, finally, improving the environmental performance of short sea shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">As a correction and in the interests of consistency, I would like to propose a purely technical oral amendment. The aim of this amendment is to bring the definition of short sea shipping in recital A, in which we included passenger transport and inland waterways, into line with that in recital C, in which we neglected to do so. My amendment therefore adds the words ‘and passengers’ and ‘or inland waterway’ to recital C, so that the definition of short sea shipping is the same throughout the report.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to remind you of what I think are the three main reasons why I am asking you to support my report on short sea shipping and the motorways of the sea. First, widespread use of short sea shipping running through all sectors of the European economy would have an extremely positive impact on the development of all regions in the European Union and would be a fantastic way of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across the continent. Secondly, short sea shipping is one of the solutions that will enable us to reconcile protection of our natural heritage with economic and social development in our regions. Finally, short sea shipping has an essential role to play in regional planning and in strengthening regional cohesion within the European Union. In that respect, I believe that the concept of motorways of the sea should be fully integrated into the issue of strengthening solidarity within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this report proposes, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that consideration should be given to the option of recognising that high-priority projects in the field of short sea shipping, which plays an important part in improving regional cohesion within the EU, are services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I will be able to enjoy the widest possible support in Parliament on a subject as important as the growth of short sea shipping and of intermodal transport. In this way, the European Union’s policies on environmental protection, regional development and regional cohesion will be strengthened for the well-being of our fellow citizens and future generations. I therefore hope that I can count on your broad support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Vice-President stated that the Commission had already taken a number of steps to promote short sea shipping, and I would ask him to regard the rapporteur’s report as a further invitation to engage in dialogue with a view to implementing further measures to promote this form of shipping. The Vice-President also referred to a number of other issues, such as simplified customs and administrative procedures and port development.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on just two points. Firstly, I would be interested to hear whether progress is finally being made with the idea of motorways of the sea. A good debate on this issue was held in this House last year following a Commission initiative, but I have my doubts as to whether the Member States are doing their bit by proposing projects. As far as the motorways of the sea are concerned, we only wish to support projects that are useful and workable, and our primary aim must be to ensure that new funding does not have a harmful impact on existing ferry and feeder links. If a perfectly adequate service has long been in existence, it would be pointless to provide fresh funding to build something new in its place. I would therefore be interested to hear how things currently stand, and whether any sensible projects for motorways of the sea have already been proposed that you feel able to support.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that no matter what lengths we go to overall to promote motorways of the sea and short sea shipping, all our good work will be undone if loopholes are repeatedly exploited by lorries. I have heard reports from the Baltic Sea region that it is a great deal cheaper to transport goods by lorry around the Baltic Sea than to use ferry or feeder services to cross it. This is due both to the fact that certain EU Member States do not monitor driving and rest periods, and also to the cheap price of Russian diesel. We must take care not to create something that in practice will be undone by the Member States’ failure to act. I would ask you to take action and to take on board the ideas contained in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall use the little time available to emphasise – particularly for the benefit of Mr Barrot – that, although we can agree with the Commission proposal, it does not include up-to-date statistical data on the growth of the various modes of transport: its figures date back to 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Collecting statistical data is extremely important but it is not taken seriously enough, even by Eurostat, especially as regards data on the origin and destination of goods transported by land. Such data would really make it possible to work on the shift to sea transport. In addition to the general survey, it would be useful to broaden the framework to include links with non-EU countries: the southern shores of the Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Black Sea, the North Sea and perhaps Russia, which could all take part in projects like the Marco Polo programme, although it is difficult to maintain regular services with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a certain confusion in the terminology relating to the definition of motorways of the sea does not help. It would need to be clarified in order to encourage replacing road usage with combined transport, not to be confused with obligatory cabotage, the aim of which is rather to improve the service. The sector that needs incentives is the continental connection sector, especially companies that transport unaccompanied semi-trailers, and such incentives should not be considered state aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to be able to transport all the goods necessary for the functioning of our economies all over Europe, while at the same time keeping our fellow citizens as safe as possible and continually ensuring that we protect our environment. Why? Because it is quite obvious that lorries are continuing to build up in bottlenecks, leading to all sorts of unpleasantness showing us human exploitation in all its glory. Many of the vessels currently engaged in cabotage are rusting hulks skimming our coasts, often only just avoiding causing real ecological disasters because of their condition.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why only public action at European level, including direct industrial and economic intervention, will be able to resolve the situation. The development of short sea shipping cannot be seen as a strategic regional planning choice. The growth in short sea shipping needs to be considered, not in competition with the necessary investment in rail freight and road-rail transport, but in synergy with it. I stress that, in maritime affairs, safety and respect for the environment must be of primary importance, with competition being secondary. The administrative procedures regarding cabotage can and must be improved, but certainly not to the point of throwing everything overboard simply on the pretext of saving time. We must retain all the monitoring methods in order to combat trafficking of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that short sea shipping has a great future ahead of it in Europe, if it is run by seamen and states and not by large concerns that are only interested in pure profit, regardless of the economic, social and human cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are both peninsulars, with sea on three sides and land on one. There are thousands of miles of coastline and thousands of large and small ports. We, as Greeks, have been very familiar with this means of transport for 3 000 years: the first cargo recorded in maritime history was the golden fleece carried by the Argonauts 5 500 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Maritime transport is the most environmentally friendly. We do not drill through mountains, we do not cut down trees and one vessel can carry a great deal of cargo and a great many passengers. We have a large volume of work: approximately 40% of traffic in Europe, according to the report. In other words, there are large profits to be made, profits for shipowners and profits for operators. However, we also have particularly high unemployment, with unemployed seafarers in Poland, Portugal and Greece. So we have very rich maritime transport, but we also have unemployed seafarers. In Piraeus, once the biggest port in Europe, one in two people walking along the street is an unemployed seafarer. So we need to find a way to introduce a measure so that every ship which calls at a European port employs a number of European seafarers. We do not want ships working in Europe with non-European seafarers while European seafarers are out of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue to which we need to turn our attention is safety. The Commission issued a directive several years ago. A civil servant, obviously serving certain interests, failed to pass it on. There was a shipwreck in the Aegean and 82 people drowned, precisely because the crew had not been trained as provided for in the directive, which had not arrived. So what do we need? We need better safety on board, we need to be strict about human life and, above all, we need to secure work for European seafarers, for reasons of equality and democracy; work which they are losing, even though, I repeat, the benefit and profit to shipowners is from European citizens. That is what justice means and I would like the Commissioner to find a way for the work of European seafarers to be secured and not to disappear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report on short sea shipping is an important one because it is a new step in our search of means of keeping freight off the roads and of promoting more environmentally friendly modes of transport. Indeed, if we do nothing, our roads will clog up. Short sea shipping can play a positive and important role in an intermodal transport system if flanking measures are taken at different levels. For example, in my view, we should not develop short sea shipping randomly, but we should carefully analyse the routes that need to be developed, in particular the ‘motorways of the sea’, in order to achieve the largest possible, positive impact. The development not only of new ports but also of new transport movements in the hinterland necessitate a strategic environmental impact report on the planned routes. We must therefore avoid new or even bigger bottlenecks being created.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must at the same time make progress on the issue of emissions. Ships pollute to some degree. Road transport has been subjected to strict standards where pollution is concerned, but marine fuels are lagging behind somewhat, and so I am pleased that, coincidentally, the Hassi report, which aims to significantly reduce the sulphur content in marine fuels, certainly in the most sensitive zones, is also being voted on this week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The unanimous approval of the present report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism demonstrates precisely the huge interest of all of us in the development of short sea shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Navarro, for the particular interest which he showed in island areas. Islands are a very sensitive sector, with acute structural problems which are exacerbated during the winter months in particular, due to the difficulty in accessing them.</p>
<p class="contents">As an elected member for an island region of Greece, I experience the acute need of island inhabitants for better and more frequent short sea communications and transport on a daily basis. Given their isolation, special measures need to be taken to improve connections with island areas. Hundreds of small inhabited islands are at risk of being abandoned, because there is no economic interest, no competition is generated. Bold subsidies are needed. It would be a pity if islands which have been inhabited for over 3 000 years were to be abandoned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The concept of motorways of the sea is starting to become a reality. At the weekend, the opening of a new motorway between Toulon and Civitavecchia, near Rome, showed the way forward. The concept of motorways of the sea is now an integral part of trans-European networks, and I very much hope that the financial perspectives will allow us to give motorways of the sea their place.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that the gathering of statistics needs to be improved and updated. The European Parliament’s definition - and I am thinking here of what you yourself emphasised, Mr Navarro, along with Mr Jarzembowski and some others - points usefully in the direction of integrating maritime transport into the intermodal chain, including river transport. We must therefore encourage states, regions and towns to cooperate as necessary. We now have a certain degree of intermodality, and we must take it further. There is no competition with rail transport but, rather, complementarity. Likewise, river and maritime transport can also complement each other very well.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I personally believe that short sea shipping has real potential - one of you said a great future - and should enable us to reduce congestion on our roads and thus to provide Europe with additional means of mobility. I therefore want to thank Parliament, which has, in this report, contributed a number of elements that I very much hope will be implemented to create an even more ambitious policy regarding short sea shipping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
