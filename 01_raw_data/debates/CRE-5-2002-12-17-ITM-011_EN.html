<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Florenz (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, this is a difficult text. Over the last 18 months a lot of people have asked me, ‘What is all this that you are doing in Europe with electronic waste? What is the point of it?’ The point is quite simply that a few years ago we in the European Union decided that we wanted to operate a sustainable policy in the economic, environmental and social fields. Six million tonnes of electronic waste every year contain an enormous quantity of valuable materials that we want to reuse in future. That is the reason for this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the members of the Conciliation Committee, and also to the Commissioner and the members of the Council who, I think, have scored a minor victory with this report on electronic waste. They enabled us to reach agreement on difficult points. We were, for example, able to state that from 2005 consumers will be more or less enjoined by their Member States – I would have preferred it to have been compulsory – not to throw appliances in the dustbin in future, but to collect them separately.</p>
<p class="contents">We have set binding targets. Unfortunately, Europe is always outstanding in its unlimited use of undefined legal terms. The hurdles we have set in this directive today are not very high, but they are nevertheless defined and binding. I think that can be called a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we are still rather vague about how such materials will be treated in future, but we have used the best available technology. I know only too well that in my country the term ‘best available technology’ is interpreted in 16 different ways, because Germany has 16 federal states. There are bound to still be loopholes, but we have nevertheless made real progress in the field of recycling quotas, too. I believe the quotas for industry are achievable and no one can say we are asking too much.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, citizens will be able to take their products to a collection point free of charge, unless the Member State goes a step further. The Member States can decide that individually.</p>
<p class="contents">I think our agreement on ‘individual financing’ was a great success. It is a step forward because we would like to have a guidance instrument and those who today are building computers that lend themselves to recycling – like this one, for example – should also be rewarded and those who want to continue producing boring old-fashioned ones in the future should be asked to contribute to the high costs of disposal. There were actually countries that did not want to take this approach. I am pleased to say that by working night and day with the help of other members in other groups we were able to persuade them to agree after all.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the packaging regulation and the end-of-life vehicles regulation, this individual liability is the first step towards a really sustainable environmental policy which, combined with economic policy, has my full support.</p>
<p class="contents">We may have succeeded in shutting out the free riders that there always are with such a system. There are big firms that order 100 000 refrigerators from the Pacific region just before Christmas and fail to put a logo on them so that the small trader or the citizen has to pick up the bill later.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made labelling compulsory so that the costs can also be assigned and resources will be available for recycling, however the Member States do it – and we are more than willing to leave that to subsidiarity. The important thing is the guarantee that it is done, and the text reflects that concern.</p>
<p class="contents">That old appliances must be managed and also paid for – in this case collectively – by the undertakings currently in existence on the market is not in question because there is no other system for doing it. We have, however, left Member States the possibility of disclosing how it is financed so that there can be a ‘visible fee’, or whatever you want to call it, for old stock. I believe this was also a good step.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have been pleased if, when debating end-of-life vehicles and electronic waste, we could have had a more aggressive and longer debate about how we might do more to encourage a flow of secondary raw materials in future. Unfortunately, we are still very fond of using new primary materials but always tend to turn up our noses at secondary materials. I might go so far as to say we should give such secondary raw materials preferential VAT treatment. That is not necessarily my group’s normal position. I do, however, believe it would be an incentive to bring about real sustainability in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what it is really about, ladies and gentlemen. We want to reuse raw materials in future. By motivating undertakings to build appliances in such a way that they can be recycled, we have found a free-market way of getting the parties concerned round the same table, and I do not need to tell anyone that for me that is an important reason. I was also very pleased to have the NGOs fighting alongside us on this question and that the undertakings and NGOs adopted a joint resolution in support of our efforts. Nothing like that has happened before in the time I have been in this House – and that is thirteen and a half years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would at this point also like to thank those colleagues who stayed on board in difficult moments. There are always plenty who fall by the wayside when the going gets tough. Again and again colleagues stuck with it whenever there was pressure from the Council, and in the end, that gave us this success – as did the excellent cooperation you gave us, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, though, this directive does have two parts. The second part is the question of how we are to deal with hazardous substances such as cadmium, lead and hexavalent chromium in future. I think we have made a small amount of progress here. Ultimately, this is about collecting and concentrating, for example, stray lead from light bulbs, small radios and small appliances with which we are all familiar. Ten tonnes of lead in one place are absolutely harmless. The same amount in small pieces all over the place, however, is a problem. The Japanese, for example, have shown us very promising approaches here, and we are now making clear to manufacturers, with appropriate incentives, that in the long term we want to create a society where these highly dangerous substances are more and more a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say a personal word to my personal colleagues who have been very busy here, working long hours and sometimes through the night.. May I once again thank my colleagues, you, Commissioner, and your staff, who always rendered us excellent assistance whenever we were faced with major questions. I was proud of this European House and would be pleased if in future things could continue in the same way with the next directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The type of waste that proliferates most quickly today is waste from electrical or electronic products. The average European produces approximately 14 kg of this type of waste every year. Most of it ends up on tips or in waste incinerators. These new directives are important milestones that will make it easier to get to grips with the future environmental problems to which our waste may lead. That is because we can now select this type of equipment for recycling and re-use and in that way also reduce its potentially dangerous effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the new directives, the Member States will be responsible for ensuring that waste from electrical and electronic products is collected separately from other waste. The directives also set a binding collection target of 4 kg per inhabitant per year from private households. In accordance with the European Parliament’s proposal, individual responsibility must form the basis for this collection target. A large quantity of dangerous substances will be phased out throughout the Community as from 1 July 2006, meaning that it will be possible to prevent many problems involving waste before they have time to arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these solutions are a great success for the European Parliament and for cooperation with the Council in the conciliation committee. I should like to repay the courtesy and thank the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, and all the members of the European Parliament’s delegation to the conciliation committee for their contributions to the constructive agreement that will be voted upon in the course of Wednesday. This is an important step for environmental policy. I should also like once again to thank Mr Florenz, who is always easy to collaborate with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a very good success for Parliament and indeed for the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union. As the Commissioner has said, it constitutes almost 14 kilograms per head and is growing by at least 3% to 5% every year. Electronic and electrical equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the waste stream. Without proper pre-treatment the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and ground water, as well as polluting the air.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive can be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy, where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco-design can be promoted. The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda, taking more account of environmental concerns, is becoming more widely accepted. Indeed business and the environmental NGOs have been on the same wavelength during this process, which is not always the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay. The adoption of this directive will be a signal in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The guiding principle behind the directive is the extent of producers' responsibility. The objective of the EPR is to make producers financially responsible for their products when these become waste so an upstream effect is created which leads to design for the environment, taking account of the durability, repairability or upgrading, disassembly or recycling of the product. In addition there is reuse of resources and separate collection, and hazardous substances contained in the WEEE are prevented from entering the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also applies the principle of internalisation of external costs. Costs of disposal, which up to now have been borne by local authorities, usually as part of waste disposal, are now to be internalised and provision made for the reuse, recycling and demanufacture of this equipment. Hence the ultimate aim is waste prevention, thus sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I congratulate my colleague, the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, on the passion he has sustained on this issue, despite all the various problems he faced from industry and the different political groups in this House, not least his own group. I thank him for his commitment and belief in both these directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances, on the one hand, and the prevention of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the other is what we are talking about here in the two directives before us. Colleagues have indicated the rate at which WEEE is growing. It is interesting to know that it will grow three times faster than the average municipal waste by 2010 – quite a frightening concept. Because of its hazardous content, electrical and electronic equipment causes environmental problems during the waste management process if it is not properly treated, sorted, separated, recycled, reused, contaminants removed etc. We can insist on improved product design, and that will facilitate recycling and the disposal of products at the end of their life. It is against this background that the two directives must be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">I noticed that at conciliation the views concerned were unanimous – and that includes views from Ireland, Portugal, Greece and other countries whose waste network and recycling systems are much less developed than in some countries in the EU. I hope our officials, ministers and others who agreed to the targets and timetables did so realistically, because we should not commit ourselves to something we cannot deliver. If it is only a matter of time before countries are dragged before the ECJ for non-compliance or non-transposition of a particular regulation, this brings into disrepute legislation passed through this House. I am glad, but slightly concerned, that they were unanimous because they might not be taking seriously what is being required of them. Knowing the state of 'underdevelopment' of recycling and waste management in my own country, Ireland, for example, I sincerely hope they mean what they say in agreeing to this directive and I fully support the fact that they have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the WEEE directive, one of the issues that caused most angst among industry was the handling of historic waste: who would pay for it and so on. It is still a concern, as I understand from industry, even though they have accepted – perhaps somewhat reluctantly – that the only way to pay is collectively and fairly. Each manufacturer of new products should cover its own costs, and the collection and treatment of all new products can be done collectively. The manufacturers will have to provide a guarantee prior to placing their products on the market to ensure the financing of subsequent disposal of the products – through insurance perhaps or a blocked bank account. In the event of the disappearance from the market of a manufacturer, such a guarantee would ensure that the costs do not have to be borne by society or by other manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should be realistic in terms of targets for and timetabling of the abolition of the dangerous substances, in particular lead and lead solder, and the concerns that have been expressed by industry. Let us be sure that technologically we are able to replace with a safer product, as far as the environment is concerned, what we are about to ban. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I find it rather silly having the same debate here with exactly the same people for the third time in plenary. The second reason is perhaps more important, however, and strikes a very positive note. This can scarcely be called a debate; these are statements by people who actually agree with each other to a large extent. That is the nice thing about the procedure we have been through since, during the first reading, that was absolutely not the case. During the discussion we have gradually come closer together. In that respect, we are a strong Parliament and a strong delegation in the negotiations. As a result, the major aspects that we put forward have actually emerged. It is no coincidence that the rapporteur should have dwelt at length on the concept of individual producer responsibility. I shall not expand on it yet again, but it is of crucial importance. It constitutes a precedent and it is the way in which we must proceed in the months and years ahead in our environmental policy. And yet, I should like to set that straight. It is not a matter of collective organisation, but of collective funding.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention a few other points that are important because none of them have been fully achieved. I am thinking, for example, of binding targets. It is true that we have binding targets, but we had to rein in the level of these. We went from 6 to 4 kilograms. I do not wish to make a particularly big issue of this, for the simple reason that I have seen how in my country, Belgium, we have managed, in one year in Flanders, to collect 4 kilos and are increasing that figure at an extremely fast rate. I am also saying this to my British fellow MEPs. I should like to invite them to Belgium. We are not top of the class in the environmental field, but, as regards waste prevention and waste recycling, we are. We are doing that to tight deadlines. If the political will is there, you can meet tight deadlines. That is why binding targets are good in themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find particularly deplorable is the question of exporting. We simply export a host of problems. In that respect, we have not achieved our target for legal reasons. I accept this regretfully, but I think we must ensure that this problem is solved through other means.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude with a final point that I personally have always defended, namely recycling. The principle is contained in the directive. I hope that, next time, we shall be able to achieve concrete targets regarding recycling too. It remains for me to thank the rapporteur and my fellow MEPs most warmly for the pleasant cooperation we have enjoyed in the course of the night. I learned a lot and enjoyed myself greatly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are made in the Council of Ministers building by exhausted people shouting at each other in corridors in the middle of the night – and the rapporteur and the Commissioner will know exactly to what I am referring.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am asked to give an example of the way in which the principles of sustainable development can be put into practice, then this directive may well be it. If I am asked about the burden of new regulations which Parliament sometimes places upon industry in the cause of environmental improvement, I will proclaim this directive as an example of the way in which industry and Parliament can work together. It is a splendid piece of legislation. It is not the end, but it is a good beginning and much credit goes to both the Commission and our rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased with the principle of individual producer responsibility, which has been so firmly embraced. Within the last week we have seen two good illustrations of the way in which industry is responding to it professionally and effectively. Four of the major manufacturers of electrical goods, including our chief lobbyist, Electrolux, have teamed up to develop a common approach to waste management which aims to be both innovative and cost efficient. And the mobile phone manufacturers of the world have agreed to cooperate to ensure the environmentally sound management of their end-of-life products.</p>
<p class="contents">My principal concern relates to – and I echo Mrs Doyle's words – the implementation of the directive. Just a few weeks ago government representatives in that room in the Council committed themselves to this legislation at the conciliation meeting. It is all supposed to be transposed into national law in about 18 months' time. But judging from our experience with the end-of-life vehicles directive, that will not be the case so far as many Member States are concerned. The UK Government has still not transposed Mr Florenz's legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission will take advantage of the European Convention to present some proposals to change the enforcement procedures to stop Member States getting away with breaking their commitments and playing the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the text of Article 4 was the matter I referred to in my opening remarks. I tabled the draft to try and deal with the problem of printer cartridges, many of which are not being recycled for anti-competitive reasons and are instead ending up in poisonous dumps in China. I hear that, sadly, the UK Government is trying to wriggle out of the intended requirement to prevent producers from making their reuse difficult by claiming that these products are consumables. It will probably take a British judge to make them recognise the obvious truth, that a cartridge fitted with an electronic chip is an item of electronic equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that other Member States will take the lead in this and in other respects in putting this directive fully into practice, and show by example just what a commendable piece of legislation this directive will prove to be. I wish you and members of the conciliation delegation, and the Commissioner and her staff, a merry Christmas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an historic breakthrough. Ten years ago, we, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, proposed individual producer responsibility in the packaging directive. At that time, we were laughed out of court. We have a packaging directive that, as we say in the Netherlands, ‘is not worth a light’, and that is because there is shared responsibility between the government and the producer. In the case of car wrecks we were almost successful two years ago. In that case, the manufacturers are largely responsible, and it is interesting to see that German industry, which at the time was so opposed to the move, now takes full responsibility. Tomorrow, we shall have achieved our goal, moreover: the manufacturers will become one hundred per cent responsible for electrical and electronic waste. It is not the case that the industry was united on the matter. The largest company in the field in my country, Philips, was decidedly antagonistic. The fact that we in this House achieved a compromise between the various groups as early as the first reading and held our ground up to the night-time session with its accompanying noisy exchanges contributed, however, to our success and, for that, I should like especially to thank Mr Florenz most sincerely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titford (EDD).</span></span>   – Mr President, the concerns about increasing quantities of electrical and electronic equipment entering the waste system have been well rehearsed. There can be no dispute that this type of waste is a problem. Furthermore, there is no dispute that the problem will continue to grow. However, there is a world of difference between agreeing that something is a problem and agreeing with a proposed solution.</p>
<p class="contents">My purpose in making this address, therefore, is to enter into the record my total disagreement with this directive. My central objection is that the directive is economically illiterate. Its effect will be to create massive quantities of materials in a highly volatile market. When quantities increase as a result of this directive, the value of recycled materials will drop, making the economics of recycling extremely uncertain. On this basis, producers and eventually their customers, are being asked to sign a blank cheque.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither does any serious consideration seem to have been given to the problem of labour recruitment. Salvaging materials is highly labour-intensive yet the work is unattractive. Either wages will have to go up sharply to meet the demand for more staff or the scheme will be bedevilled by labour shortages. The recycling plants required to meet this directive are highly capital-intensive. With such uncertain returns it seem unlikely that there will be any commitment to providing the necessary facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to add to a list of objections that is by no means complete the fact that, as we have learned to expect from EU legislation, the system is highly bureaucratic, adding massive overheads and a totally unnecessary burden on industry. It also requires Member States to create yet more criminal offences to regulate the commercial market. Is turning our businessmen into criminals really what European unity is really all about? Is this really what Monnet planned? Surely there is a better way.</p>
<p class="contents">Logically, if there are tax breaks for companies which use recycled materials and import controls which favour equipment with high proportions of recycled materials as well as tax breaks for companies that process the materials, this would create a market. One could find that, as with the car batteries' recycling – before the EU destroyed it – a new market would be created. Properly designed such a scheme could permit end-users to be paid for delivering waste material, which is exactly what happened with car batteries and the reason why – before the EU intervened – we managed to recycle over 80% of car batteries. With that degree of cooperation the most expensive part of the scheme – collection costs – are minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that, whenever there is a choice between a simple and effective scheme and one that is costly, bureaucratic and inefficient and also criminalises the business fraternity, the European Union always goes for the latter. If you need an explanation as to why there is growing disenchantment with the European Union, just look at this directive and the many more like it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, producers are now to be made responsible for the complete life cycles of the equipment they sell. The unambiguous application of individual producer liability is something that I, as the person who originally proposed the amendment, am especially glad about. This is precisely the way we can ensure that product design takes account of the environment and therefore the directive’s whole viability. If producers know they are the ones that have to pay when equipment reaches the end of its life cycle, they will minimise costs beforehand and ensure that as little waste as possible is created and that that small amount has maximum potential for recycling. Parliament’s wish to prevent anyone from getting a ‘free ride’ has also been taken into consideration in a fair way, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, by demanding that producers should provide a guarantee to cover costs when products are released for sale.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to mention our rapporteur’s splendid solution regarding the obligation to recycle, something that has been fully achieved, but regarding which there has to be evidence of a rate of four kilograms of waste per inhabitant a year. Thus, not a gram of waste is to remain without someone taking responsibility for it, although for various practical reasons – and this was the compromise that was finally reached during conciliation – the obligation regarding evidence itself is in respect of just 4 kilograms. The entire chain, therefore – producers, importers, dealers, consumers, organisers of waste disposal and recycling, and the authorities – will each be in a responsible position, but the balance of responsibility among them that has been found is excellent. Furthermore, market mechanisms have been used just as they should: there will be positive incentives to encourage more ecological behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it has to be said that the position taken by the Council right up to the last moment to solve the question of costs would not have worked in this way and it would not have had such an ecological impact, although it might have been tempting for Member States in terms of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Member States also find a fair solution regarding how collection facilities are organised. In so far as it is possible, it will be the responsibility of the local authorities, and the producer’s liability for costs starts at the collection point.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have found an excellent model in the WEEE Directive, which, hopefully soon, we will be able to apply to many other product groups. When the Commission is drafting proposals on these may it be encouraged by the unanimous support we have had for the proposal now before us from environmental and consumer organisations, as well as the industry itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a substantial and very important proposal. When fully implemented it will bring about a transformation in the culture of recycling in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur can be truly proud of his work and he is to be congratulated on it. The requirements in these two proposals: firstly, to ensure recycling of substantial quantities of waste electronic and electrical goods, and, secondly, to ensure substantial reductions in the amount of hazardous substances in these products will be technically and financially very difficult to achieve for many people. Patience must be shown with some Member States that are starting from scratch and have very little infrastructure for recycling. In particular we cannot expect the new accession states to achieve easily or quickly the high levels of recycling of these products that already exist in some more advanced Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be pleased that individual consumers can expect to return their waste appliances free of charge, and that the primary responsibility for collection and disposal of waste electrical and electronic goods will be with the producer. However, we may see the unfortunate situation of local authorities – and consequently local taxpayers – dealing with orphan and some historic waste. In that situation, the governments that have agreed to this proposal have a responsibility to support financially this necessary work. Despite all the difficulties that I foresee in implementing this proposal in parts of the Union, we are taking a very important step tonight and tomorrow when we vote on it – it brings us all a very practical step forward towards a sustainable future for the European economy and a sustainable future for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to thank him because he initially took quite a different position on the end-of-life vehicles directive. I think it is a sign of greatness to change your position and make clear that producer liability is possible. If we had not found so satisfactory a solution to the problems with the end-of-life vehicles directive, we would not have been able to adopt this directive, either, because it would not have been evident why some were excluded from producer liability and others not.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe it is a very great success not only for the environment but also for consumer protection. I think it is very important that consumers will in future be able to have greater certainty that prices are telling the ecological truth and that consumers need not buy new hardware with every new software program. In this way, we are also giving industry incentives to pursue not only environmentally friendly policies but also consumer-friendly ones. I think it is very important that we have succeeded in arranging this individual financing and also that we were able to prevent the Council having its way and that small and medium-sized undertakings will not be released from liability. I would, however, also ask the Commission to strictly control and enforce this individual financing later. Only then will this directive really be a milestone in environmental and consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has put his heart into his report, he has fought for it and I believe he has achieved a good result. I believe putting the focus on firms’ own liability goes to the heart of the problem. In future, these firms will be able to participate in public tenders, serve local and regional public institutions and invite tenders. That means things can get much cheaper for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem that of course arises for small and medium-sized firms is how they are to provide a guarantee for various services. The question of how they are to provide such guarantees in the future is raised at this very time with the Basel II rules, which are all about creditworthiness, securities and transparency. It is important that national, regional or local political decision makers give some thought to how they can help small and medium-sized undertakings over guarantees in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is the bans on substances. I think the Commission should be very careful to ensure that proof of sustainability is furnished in the next three years, so that we can see that these bans really do make for a better, more sustainable, more ecological performance. Consumption and costs must not be allowed to increase in certain areas because of the bans, putting a counterproductive burden on the system.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I believe the discussion has been most worthwhile. I would also like to sincerely thank the Commissioner because it is also an important forward-looking step in the area of refuse and waste and because small and medium-sized firms are being given completely new opportunities here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
