<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Roth‐Behrendt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard from the President that today we are considering the second reading on product liability. Let me trace its history. All of us in this Parliament – unanimously, I believe – said here in November 1997, following the BSE affair – and the way it dealt with BSE has been one of Parliament"s major successes – that product liability needs to be amended so that in future we can deal with the damage caused by BSE. Thereupon the Commission made a proposal that integrates and includes primary agricultural products. That was a welcome development. However, Mr Monti, it was the least you could do. I have always told you in the past that you pursed your lips but did not whistle! I criticise you for that. Were you not at present a member of the Commission but still, shall we say, working in a different capacity, then I would say to you today that what you have done seems almost to date from the stone age. So I will not say it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment we have now added eight amendments for the second reading of the common position. Eight amendments is not very many. As rapporteur, I have tried to be very moderate and have only tabled those amendments that obtained a majority at the first reading and that, in my view, could also bring about a compromise in other parts of the House. There are of course people in this House and outside it who say: we do not want any amendments. Let us accept this proposal as it stands! We should accept the Commission proposal, the common position, as it stands. My reply to these people and to the Members who said this at first reading is that Parliament should be consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we said we need changes in connection with BSE, then if we are to be logical we must also cover the case of people who have contracted the new form, the new variant of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease. We all know that the incubation period can last from 10 to 20 years. So, in order to be consistent, the Committee on the Environment has extended the period of enforcement of the rights conferred upon the injured person to 20 years in the case of a hidden defect – which is all we are talking about here – instead of 10 years. Anyone who contracted Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease would never be able to claim damages because that person or the family may not find out about the disease for more than 10 years after it had been contracted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also raised the amount of the total liability for damage from ECU 70 million to ECU 140 million and have left this up to the Member States. That is not so very drastic either and it should be possible to reach a compromise on it in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you, including Mr Monti, have said that this legislation is being reviewed in any case. After all, a green paper is due by 1 January 2000. But even when the Commission was still more able to act than it is now, I doubted whether you could produce that green paper on time. Now I am convinced and we all know that it cannot be done by 1 January 2000. You yourself said, on behalf of the Commission, that you would not be embarking on any new projects, which certainly also means no new legislation. The first thing a new Commission does will not be to produce a green paper. Even if we got a green paper, it would take two or three, or even four or five years for the legislation to come along. Surely that cannot be what we want! Nor could we accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now address a few of the Members, and I am looking in particular at the PPE Group, because Mrs Grossetête, who like myself is a member of the Committee on the Environment, said at first reading that people do not want this in the first place and that I would be upsetting all manner of things with this amendment. In fact it was particularly with the PPE Group in mind that I totally dropped the question of the reversal of the burden of proof, for example, and questions relating to the burden of proof. So my request to you, Mrs Grossetête, is to reconsider your position on these two amendments on the expiry date and the amount of liability for damage; for let me tell you that people definitely want us to attend to their personal, their very personal welfare, and not just before the European elections but quite generally!</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we have tried to do in the Committee on the Environment, which is responsible for consumer protection and health policy. We have tried to do so by tabling eight amendments, some of which were taken over from the members of the PPE Group and concern the definition and revision of the legislation. By means of these amendments we have extended the expiry date and changed the amount of liability for damage. None of this will bankrupt anyone in the European Union. There will however be potential damage, and not just in the case of contaminated stored blood which can cause AIDS; that is something I am not discussing at all, I am sticking to primary products here. In cases of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob, we are giving the public security. I would hope that these amendments will never be needed because nobody will fall ill. But if that should be the case after all, then the people of the European Union are entitled to expect us to create a proper legal basis for product liability and for their claims to damages.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are doing no more and no less here with these amendments. I do not believe we are being over‐ambitious or over‐demanding. I ask you to support these amendments at second reading so that we can endeavour to achieve a sensible solution in the codecision procedure with the Council.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Grossetête </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we very much welcome the fact that the Commission has decided to extend the scope of Directive 85/374/EEC to primary agricultural products, as requested by the European Parliament following the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must say straightaway to Mrs Roth‐Behrendt that we cannot support her proposals because she has taken advantage of this opportunity to amend the content of the directive. Her proposals not only change the definition given to primary agricultural products, they also introduce the concept of psychological damage, scrap the lower threshold and remove the financial ceiling. Finally, and this is particularly serious in my view, they extend the period of limitation from 10 to 20 years for damage resulting from a hidden defect. The fact is that when there is damage as a result of a hidden defect, it is generally discovered at the point when the damage occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the problem of the poor farmers. It has already proved very hard to tell them that their products will fall within the scope of this directive. Our farmers are very concerned about the future and the CAP reform, yet we are now asking them to accept liability which they cannot do in the manner proposed by Mrs Roth‐Behrendt. In any case, the directive provides for the possibility of the people involved in the production process being jointly and severally liable, so when a problem occurs, such as BSE which Mrs Roth‐Behrendt mentioned, liability is already incurred. If we approve Mrs Roth‐Behrendt"s proposals, you can just imagine the insurance cover which farmers would have to take out and which could become exorbitant.</p>
<p class="contents">You are no doubt wondering where the consumer stands in all this. My answer is to wait for the Green Paper which the Commission has undertaken to prepare for the year 2000 after consultations with producers, distributors, consumers, farmers and insurers. The balance of a directive cannot be changed without taking time to carry out a preliminary study, even where consumer protection is involved, and as I have explained, consumers are already protected by the fact that any producer whose product has caused damage bears liability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth‐Behrendt"s good intentions are really just pandering to people"s prejudices, because her desire to protect consumers without a proper preliminary study means that farmers are going to be overwhelmed and the courts flooded. This is why, regrettably, we cannot support Mrs Roth‐Behrendt"s proposals.</p>

Only with clear legislation and proper information can consumers be full players in the market who decide for themselves which products are sold and which they want to buy. Liability will ensure that producers are careful about how they produce. The aim is to preclude all risks to consumer health as a result of product defects. If the producer has not been careful enough, the consumer is then guaranteed his rights.</p>
<p class="contents">BSE played a major part in the genesis of this report. It acted as a catalyst to ensure that agricultural products are now also covered by the rules on liability for defective products. Carelessness has led to the deaths of a number of people from Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease. If there had been clear rules on liability, the chances of that happening would have been far smaller.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth‐Behrendt made one emphatic point at first reading. She wanted all unsafe products covered by the rules. In principle I agree, and I think that she showed courage at first reading. But I did not support her on it. I think that such an important and problematic subject calls for a detailed discussion and balanced decisions. I did not think it right to decide on that as an incidental point in a different report.</p>
<p class="contents">My group and I wholeheartedly support the amendments which Mrs Roth‐Behrendt has tabled now at second reading.</p>

I do not accept the Commission"s excuse that the directive in question needs to be extensively revised in the context of Agenda 2000. The Council too has failed to take the European Parliament seriously in totally ignoring the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is quite right in retabling the amendments in question. The acute nature of the BSE crisis showed that liability for defective products needs to be widened as quickly as possible. The change should also include the closing of other loopholes which exist at present, so that the work does not have to be done twice. Parliament"s aims do indeed go further than the Commission"s. To my mind, that is not in itself a reason to reject these amendments, especially since the President of Parliament has declared the amendments to be admissible.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard the raising of the ceiling from EUR 70 to 140 million as important. It is not acceptable for a consumer who buys a defective product to be denied compensation because he is not the first, but the umpteenth person to make a claim. And I find it only fair that if damage or loss sustained as a result of a defective product occurs only after ten years, the deadline for claims should be extended to 20 years.</p>

With the current proposal, the Commission is intending to increase consumer protection in regard to the safety of food and primary agricultural products. In this extremely sensitive area, the directive is to be extended so that it also covers agricultural raw materials, which were excluded until now. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 must certainly be supported, because they ensure that those who produce genetically modified seeds can also be held responsible for any consequences. Farmers must not be held liable for damage for which the large undertakings are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission proposal was also used as an opportunity to table certain amendments that seriously impinge on national civil law and have no real basis. That is why we cannot endorse the extension of the directive to cover agricultural products.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graenitz </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for her proposals and for taking the opportunity to put forward proposals by Parliament that go beyond what the Commission proposed. I believe that even at the time it proposed these legislative changes we could have expected the Commission to make further‐reaching proposals, instead of spending years discussing something that should have been done a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now told we will be getting a green paper next year, but I cannot imagine that we will have completed the legislation before the year 2002. Let me just point out that so far there has been no follow‐up at all to the green paper on the future of food legislation which we voted on a year ago and concerning which everyone fully endorsed Parliament"s proposals. That is to say, no law was proposed to implement what we decided at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not find it acceptable to let time pass and do nothing in an area that is so important to every citizen of the European Union. In fact I am very surprised to find that my colleagues on the other side of the House have suddenly forgotten a great many of the things we once decided here unanimously and jointly a year and a half ago in the wake of the BSE decision.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another matter to which I would draw attention. If we include liability for primary agricultural products in the directive on liability, then in my view we really will have to complete the chain. In fact I tabled an amendment on the subject at first reading, which was accepted. I do not think we should hold the farmers alone liable, without enabling them to go back to the producers of their primary products. That is essential. Perhaps it is not so much a chain as a circle that we have to close here, to ensure that in the end every producer is responsible for what he puts on the market, but that he also assumes this responsibility over a fairly long period of time especially for products which we know can cause illnesses that cannot be detected after one year or even after 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I really would ask colleagues to consider that if we grasp this opportunity we should be pleased about it. We are taking speedier action on European legislation this time and we should not hang about and expose ourselves to the criticism that we are leaving the consumers out in the cold!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, I endorse emphatically what my colleague Mrs Graenitz said, both in congratulating the rapporteur and speaking to those elements in these amendments which seem to me to be profoundly important. I refer in particular to Amendments Nos 5 and 6. Mrs Roth‐Behrendt, like me, had to listen to much of the evidence about BSE, about the extraordinary nature of this disease and how it finally transferred itself to humankind.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are looking now at the terms of liability and the extent of the financial recompense that may be necessary, it is no longer good enough to say that the hidden defects in a particular product, particularly one derived from foodstuffs or medicines, will necessarily appear within ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I have come to this debate today almost directly from a meeting with the relations of people who have lost children to new variant CJD, the human form of BSE. Not all of them got it from infected foodstuffs by the direct route. Some got it from growth hormones. People look back to thalidomide and think that the dangers of a given product emerge very quickly, in birth defects or something of that kind. We now understand much more clearly that this is not the case and that very often the defects in a particular product begin to manifest themselves over the lifetime of the individual concerned. Unless we have the opportunity which these amendments provide for action to be taken within the normal processes over a longer period of time, we run the risk that the manufacturers of products may escape liability without expensive legal proceedings intended once again to change the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth‐Behrendt's amendments also provide for a process of review from the year 2000 onwards and that too is eminently correct. I would simply congratulate the rapporteur again and apologise for not being here to hear her speech.</p>

I believe she has carried out very useful work on both the subjective and the objective and circumstantial aspects of the directive. As regards the subjective aspects, the notions of producer and product have been broadened. The latter now includes products derived from agriculture and cattle breeding as well as manufactured goods. Intermediate products are covered in addition to end products. The great importance of precursors has already been mentioned this morning, and genetically modified material which has not been properly inspected ought to be added in the future. It is wise to extend the time period, as symptoms may take more than 10 years to appear in the case of bovine spongiform encephalitis and other known diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is extremely important to include the mental consequences of these diseases as well as the physical ones. Given our experiences with rape oil and methylated spirit, we in Spain are very conscious of how dreadful the mental consequences can be.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as compensation is concerned, the sum of EUR 70 million referred to earlier seems insignificant set against the whole economy of the Union. I feel it is quite right to increase it to at least EUR 140 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like Parliament to follow up the good idea of partially reversing the burden of proof in this field. It should be borne in mind that producers often build up a particular atmosphere or context to make consumption of their product appear natural and normal. In such circumstances, it should not be up to the consumer alone to produce the evidence, when there is general awareness that the disease has resulted from dangerous methods of production.</p>

We have very grave reservations, especially concerning Amendment No 4, which drops the retention provision, and Amendment No 5, which extends the expiry date to 20 years. I wonder whether we should not reconsider them.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Amendments Nos 1 and 2 is different. They define the raw materials of agricultural and forestry products. I know that the Council working group discussed whether a definition should not be set out at least in the recitals. The line then taken was that a producer who genetically modifies seeds would in any case have to be regarded as the producer of a raw material and it was not considered necessary to clarify this further. I think that is quite wrong. I believe it is absolutely essential to endorse these two amendments. They would ensure that farmers who use genetically modified products can have recourse to the producers of the genetically modified seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">That could not be done under the proposal as it stands now. Farmers, any small farmer, could be held liable for damage caused by genetically modified products – a quite inconceivable and unthinkable situation! – while those responsible for the genetic modifications, large companies like Monsanto and Novartis, would not be in any way liable. That cannot be in our interest! So I urge you most sincerely to endorse these two amendments.</p>

The Council will be our partner in the codecision procedure, but I am looking to the other side of the House. I am addressing you, Mrs Grossetête, because we have discussed this matter directly in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and here in the Chamber too.</p>
<p class="contents">You said I was amending the content of the directive too much. You referred to the definition. That is precisely where I am protecting the farmers, as your colleagues have just said. Mrs Flemming has just said it again too. These are amendments that I have taken over and that came from your group and my group and I am assuming that you will have to endorse Amendments Nos 1 and 2, particularly if you want to support the farmers. Moreover, I would ask you again to look very closely at Amendments Nos 5 and 6, the question of extending the expiry date for hidden defects and of increasing the total liability amount. With regard to the question of extending the expiry date for hidden defects, in the past few weeks 10 people have contracted the new variant of CJD, 10 people! These people have been infected with the disease at some point in the last few years, in the last 15, 18 or 20 years, we do not know exactly when. It was a hidden defect and the people who have been injured have to prove this themselves. The injured person is responsible for proving it! You can imagine how often he would succeed in doing so, and yet we want to offer that chance. I am convinced we must do so.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, some Members said that increasing the liability amount we allow the Member States from EUR 70 million to EUR 140 million is something we leave up to the Member States and is still not an enormous total amount. Mrs Grossetête, you said something that worried me a little but to which I would also respond. You said that farmers fear the future in any case. But what we are doing is precisely to protect the farmers! Just consider this: a farmer may buy animal fodder in all good conscience and feed it to his animals in the conviction that it contains no animal protein because it is not labelled as such, these are still not labelled. Yet it does contain animal protein and his animals contract BSE and damage occurs. Then it is not he who is responsible but the supplier of the animal fodder! What we are doing is precisely to protect the farmer with the amendments on hidden defects.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would ask you again to take a look at Amendments Nos 5 and 6 and at least to try to support them, in addition to Nos 1 and 2, so that we can perhaps fight together for an even better solution during the conciliation procedure.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following the European Parliament's recommendations on BSE, or more specifically the recommendation to extend – by the end of September 1997 – the no‐fault liability regime provided for in Directive 85/374 to primary agricultural products and game, the Commission presented its proposal on 1 October 1997. The 1985 directive establishes the right for any victim to be compensated for injury caused by a defective product, without having to prove the fault of the producer. In extending this right to the agricultural sector, the Commission is reverting to its original proposal of 1976.</p>
<p class="contents">At Parliament's first reading, in November 1998, a majority came out in support of this principle. The Council was likewise in favour of it, adopting the Commission proposal unanimously. Unfortunately, there is nevertheless a risk that the aim shared by all three institutions – namely to extend the regime to the farm sector – might not be achieved, should Parliament and the Council disagree on the timing of a thorough review of the 1985 basic directive, going beyond the limited aim I have just described. Indeed, by resubmitting the amendments adopted at first reading, your committee responsible is encouraging you to amend the common position. As I said, the Council unanimously approved the Commission's text, ruling out any possibility of reviewing the 1985 directive on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, this is an important and very urgent matter. It is crucial that an agreement should be reached on the basis of the common position, thereby extending the rules on civil liability to the agricultural sector. Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 to 7, relating to mental injuries, exemption, the time‐limit for claims, the maximum amount, and amendment of the directive in the year 2000. The other three amendments, relating exclusively to primary agricultural products – Amendments Nos 1 and 2 on liability for injury caused by intermediate products and the means of production, and No 8 on the obligation to present an impact study in the year 2000 – are superfluous in view of the interpretation generally given to Articles 2, 3 and 21 of the 1985 directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, as the Commission stated last November, the best time and the best way to engage in a review of the 1985 directive is when discussing the report on the application of the directive, which the Commission must present to Parliament and the Council in 2000. That report will be preceded by wide‐ranging consultations, open to all the sectors concerned, in the form of a green paper to be presented as soon as this proposal has been adopted. This is the fastest way of producing a proposal for an amendment taking full account of the importance of the directive to the socio‐economic fabric and encompassing all the elements relevant to a review of the 1985 directive. I therefore hope that the European Parliament will support this approach, without altering the Council's common position, thereby not only enabling its own recommendation of 19 February 1997 to be carried out, but also bringing forward the start of consultations leading to the year 2000 report.</p>
