There is reason to believe that this was done by Turkish death squads. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident, because every week, we receive reports of such crimes against Kurds. I am sure you are familiar with the news that the second-in-command of the Turkish army himself was named as the organiser of a criminal gang which aims to eliminate Kurdish separatists.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore written to Commissioner Rehn, asking him to get the Commission to mount a thorough and independent inquiry into the circumstances of these brutal killings, which should not go unpunished.

However, one should also be aware that, in 2001, this company was created to prevent the problems affecting the cathode-ray screen market from putting the holding company, Philips, at a disadvantage. Behaviour such as this is extremely serious because it allows our large companies to shirk their economic, social and industrial responsibilities. Promises were made to the workers employed by these three factories but, to date, these promises have come to nothing. Furthermore, this liquidation reminds us of the events that took place in the Isère region with regard to HP and also reminds us that the large groups are doing as they please and are gradually dismantling Europe’s industrial policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is becoming increasingly dependent on supplies and it is clear that we will have to solve energy problems together. We must, for example, fully complete the liberalisation of the internal market and work together to save energy and to develop alternative sources of energy, including atomic energy. We must also tackle the issue of energy security together. I have said before that I am very much in favour of this Green Paper, and that it should kickstart discussion.

The atmosphere during the election campaign is dangerous. The campaign has been marked by Aleksandr Kozulin, a presidential candidate, being heavily beaten by secret service men. In addition, many activists are being arrested and threatened, to stop them supporting the democratic candidate Aleksandr Milinkievich.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, statements were made by some EU office holders which I found disappointing. After it became known that the European Parliament is planning to send an ad hoc delegation to Minsk, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner stated that the members of that delegation will speak only for themselves. Mr President, may I kindly ask you to remind the Commission that Members of this House are the only elected representatives of the EU citizens, in contrast to the Members of the European Commission. Members of the European Parliament are entitled to speak of behalf of those who elected them and not only for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is highly regrettable that the European Commission makes lamentable statements instead of expressing at least their moral support for the MEPs who are going to observe elections in Minsk, and instead of stating that in the event of any provocation by the Lukashenko regime against parliamentarians they are ready to take action in their defence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She recently took it upon herself to send a letter to the Polish Government concerning the merger of two Polish banks. I thought it might have been appropriate for the Commissioner to share her country’s first-hand knowledge of how to lose a referendum on the Constitution with the Polish Government. Instead, the Commissioner saw fit to preach to the Polish Government, even though a Dutch bank, the ING, had been very quick off the mark in buying one of the larger Polish banks, <span class="italic">Bank Śląski</span>. The Commissioner’s offensive letter is paternalistic in the extreme, and typical of the attitude of the countries of the old Union to the new Member States. The Commissioner might have been more usefully employed preaching to the Dutch Government on how to prevent ethnic and racist tension, which is unfortunately fast becoming a fact of life in her country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately the change over to digital TV in Malta is creating new monopolies where consumers are simply being asked to pay for the screening of popular sports events which until today have been enjoyed free of charge. Moreover we are witnessing the formation of a factual state in which there is no interoperability between the different systems of digital television. This means that it is very difficult to interchange systems with the result that the choice of the consumer is being limited. Even worse, our consumers are being asked to pay private operators to receive national channels which until today they had been receiving free of charge while the authorities still expect them to pay the same amount for the television licence. The digital era is supposed to be such that information and entertainment are accessible to all rather than to an increasingly restricted number of people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorist groups are also blowing up Orthodox churches in the zone, and those churches are not only places of religious worship but also part of our common European heritage.
