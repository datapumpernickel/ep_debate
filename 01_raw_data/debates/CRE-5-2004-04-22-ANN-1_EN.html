<p>Cabinda, which became a Portuguese protectorate in 1885 and which is separated from Angola by the DRC, was occupied by MPLA armed forces in 1975. Today it is still under the control and at the mercy of the Angolan forces, as demonstrated by the many acts of violence committed by these forces against the Cabindan population. The Western oil multinationals, which deprive the Cabindans of their considerable mineral resources, are also responsible for hindering the development and liberation of this small enclave.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council is not aware of any internationally recognised "Republic of Cabinda". Concerning the citizens of the Cabinda enclave, they enjoy, on the basis of the national Constitution, the same development perspectives and fundamental rights as the rest of the people living in Angola.</p>
<p>2. The basis for the EU relations with Angola in this respect is laid down in the Cotonou agreement. In its conclusions on Angola, adopted on 13 October 2003, the Council underlined that the European Union would pursue a certain number of objectives with regard to Angola, among which is EU support of the process of national reconciliation and democracy. This would be done through the promotion of good governance and a culture of tolerance among all political parties and all sectors of civil society. The Council emphasised European Union support for the ongoing efforts for a lasting peace in all the 18 provinces of the country. These issues are focussed upon in the EU’s ongoing dialogue with the Government of Angola under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0137"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has only recently begun to address the financial perspectives for 2007-2013. The Commission legislative proposals are expected to be put forward in June/July 2004. Therefore, the Council is not yet in a position to assess the impact of a EU budget of 1.24% GDP on the cohesion policy and the Objective 1 regions.</p>
<p>The Council (GAERC), at its session held on 23 February 2004, took note of the presentation by the President of the Commission of the communication on the EU's financial perspective, "Building our common future: policy challenges and budgetary means of the Enlarged Union 2007–2013," and held an initial exchange of views. The Presidency intends to pursue work on the communication until the end of May with a view to the forthcoming presentation by the Commission of its package of concrete proposals.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 25/26 March 2004 in Brussels, the European Council welcomed the opening of discussions on the Commission's Communication on the Financial Perspectives 2007-2013. It invited Council to continue the study being conducted by Coreper on the Communication, with a view to preparation of an analytical report in advance of the European Council in June 2004. The European Council recalled the timetable envisaged in the Multiannual Programme, which aims at reaching political agreement on the new Financial Perspectives at the European Council in June 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0141"></a>

<p>(EN) As you are all aware high levels of external debt in many poor countries have resulted in debt service obligations that have consumed Government revenues and reduced critical public expenditure on essential basic services and social and economic infrastructure. The impact of debt on public expenditure programmes hits the poor in a number of ways that multiply its impact on them.</p>
<p>As stated in the Monterrey Consensus, agreed in March 2002 by the Heads of State and Government of the UN Members States, the EU recognises that sustainable debt financing is an important element for mobilising resources for public and private investment. The EU strongly supports the view that external debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that can be redirected towards activities consistent with attaining poverty reduction, sustainable growth and development including in the health and education sectors of developing countries.</p>
<p>The Council would also remark that the EU objective remains to ensure that, within the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the eligible countries can reach and maintain a sustainable level of debt in the long term, thus reinforcing their efforts to reduce poverty and promote growth. The EU is also examining ways of going beyond the current HIPC initiative.</p>
<p>The EU has also highlighted, as part of the HIPC review, the need to maintain and strengthen the link between debt relief and nationally owned and determined poverty reduction strategies comprised of a range of policies aimed at improved social programmes, good governance and widely shared economic growth. In our dialogue with developing countries, we have strongly advocated that these strategies should be clearly linked to the agreed international development goals, with measurable indicators and progress such as in the areas of health and education.</p>
<p>On the wider question of debt relief, the Council would remark that the HIPC initiative has provided significant levels of debt relief for many poor countries. It has not, however, provided the “sustainable exit” from the debt treadmill that had been envisaged. The failure to treat the poverty status of indebted countries and the vulnerability of their economies to the effects of external shocks was a major factor in the limited impact of the initiative. The fact that, in some cases, the relief provided was financed by existing ODA and not from additional resources from donors also reduced the net benefits to HIPCs.</p>
<p>You will be aware that the EU has argued that in future reviews of debt sustainability, account should be taken of the impact of debt relief on progress towards the achievement of the development goals of the Millennium Declaration, especially in the fields of health and education.</p>
<p>EU member states have provided significant relief of bilateral debt owed by developing countries and have also financed the relief of multilateral debt through the HIPC trust fund and through separate initiatives. If the substantial resources we have provided are to be effective in achieving the desired objectives, further initiatives will be necessary including measures that address the way that loan financing of development is administered and how this impacts on debt sustainability.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0148"></a>

<p>On a number of occasions, the European Parliament has expressed its wish that the Council should appoint a special representative for Tibet.

<p>1. The GAERC at its meeting in June 2003 invited the Commission, with the contribution, where appropriate, of the High Representative, to present from 2004 onwards detailed proposals on Action Plans for all countries concerned as appropriate commencing with Ukraine and Moldova to the east and those Mediterranean Partners with whom the EU had association agreements in force (i.e. Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, Israel). It was subsequently decided to include the Palestinian Authority in this first wave. First technical consultations with some partner countries were held in January-February 2004. The Commission services have elaborated working documents on possible elements for the Action Plans.</p>
<p>2. Coreper on 10 March 2004 discussed guiding principles for the establishment of Action Plans and tasked competent Working Groups to look at the working documents. The Working Groups produced a joint paper summarising the views of Member States. This was considered at Coreper on 1 April 2004.</p>
<p>These discussions and their results provide part of the basis on which the Commission will work up and adopt its proposals for Action Plans, which will then be submitted to the Council for further discussion. In the meantime further consultations with partner countries are being held as appropriate. It is currently intended that Coreper should consider the Commission's overall strategy in mid May and decide then whether the draft Action Plans should be approved by the Council in June 2004 or deferred for consideration until the following month.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0153"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council recalls to the Honourable Parliamentarian that the EU’s approach to Conflict Prevention is set out in the “EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts” which was adopted by the European Council in Gothenburg in June 2001. Conflict Prevention also lies at the heart of the European Security Strategy adopted by the European Council last December.</p>
<p>The Presidency has identified conflict prevention as a priority for the first semester of 2004. The focus for work is the EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, and the Presidency will be submitting a report on the implementation of this Programme to the June 2004 European Council. Work in this area is being brought forward by the Presidency across a range of issues, one of which relates to improved cooperation with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). This is set out clearly as an objective in the Presidency’s work programme.</p>
<p>In this context, and in association with the European Centre for Conflict Prevention (ECCP), the Presidency hosted a working level conference in Dublin from 31 March to 2 April, which was attended by representatives of NGOs and civil society. The objective of this conference was to examine how cooperation between the EU and NGOs can be developed and enhanced and to make concrete proposals for further work in this area. Another objective of the Conference was to reinforce EU action in conflict prevention by focussing on the EU's recognition of the role of NGOs / civil society.</p>
<p>The conference was opened by my colleague, Mr. Tom Kitt, Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Overseas Development. Key-note addresses were delivered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Brian Cowen, by the South African Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Zuma, and by the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, and Chair-in-Office of the African Union, Mr. Simao.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0156"></a>

<p>Seven years ago the Treaty of Amsterdam set the deadline of 1 May 2004 for common asylum rules and responsibility-sharing, and a common framework for legal, managed migration. These are even more essential now than seven years ago, in the light of enlargement and increased migration challenges.</p>
<p>Has the Irish Presidency been able to fulfil its pledge to get the European asylum system in place through agreement on the outstanding draft directives on refugee definition and procedures? What progress has it made on measures for legal immigration? How would the Council assess overall progress of the last five years since the Tampere European Council?</p>
<p>Can the Council advise how MEPs should account to voters in June 2004 for any EU failure to fulfil the pledge of a common asylum system and coordinated rules on managed migration, given that polls show European citizens have identified asylum and immigration as one of the top three issues for the European Parliament elections?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council invites the Honourable Parliamentarians to refer to the statement of the Presidency on behalf of the Council on 11 February 2004, regarding the progress made in the implementation of the Tampere agenda. In that statement, the Presidency underlined the measures taken to date, and the proposals under consideration, in the framework of the Council, in the areas of asylum, legal migration and in combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p>With regard to the establishment of a Common European Asylum System, it must be acknowledged that a significant number of measures have already been adopted by the Council. As regards the Qualification Directive specifically, the Council, at its meeting on 30 March 2004, reached an agreement on this key element of a Common European Asylum System. The Council recalls that the main aim of this Directive is, on the one hand, to ensure that Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of protection and, on the other hand, to ensure that a minimum level of benefits is available for these persons in all Member States. The Council has instructed its preparatory bodies to finalise the text in order to adopt it before 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>With regard to the Asylum Procedures Directive, which is intended to provide for "minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status" a number of key issues, remain outstanding. They are concerned with provisions relating to safe third countries and safe countries of origin and appeals procedures. Under this Presidency, other key outstanding issues relating to the scope of the Directive, the personal interview and legal assistance have been resolved.</p>
<p>The JHA Council on 30 March 2004 held an orientation debate on the main outstanding issues of this proposal. Following the debate, the Council instructed its preparatory bodies to continue work on the proposal with a view to reaching an agreement within the time-limit set by the Amsterdam Treaty (1 May 2004).</p>
<p>The Council is of the view therefore that, although further steps are still necessary, considerable work has been achieved towards the completion of the objectives defined in Tampere.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0162"></a>

<p>(EN) The treaty does not provide for permanent seats for any Member State on the ECB Executive Board. Article 112 of the treaty provides indeed that in order to be nominated to the ECB Executive Board, the candidates must be persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters and nationals of Member States.</p>
<p>The procedure for nomination is by common accord of Heads of State or Government of euro Member States on the basis of a recommendation of the (Ecofin) Council. The European Parliament has to be consulted beforehand on the recommended candidate and in that framework hearings of such recommended candidates by its competent Committee have been organised in the past. The European Central Bank must also be consulted prior to the final decision by the Heads of State or Government.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 2 May 1998, which the first appointments to the Executive Board of the ECB were agreed, the Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the Treaty requirement to make appointments from persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, and the roles of the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. They also undertook to give appropriate weight and appropriate consideration, according to a balanced principle of rotation, in their future decisions under Article 109 a (2), to the recommendations for nationals of Member States which do not provide members of the Executive Board appointed in accordance with Article 50 of the ECB Statute.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council recalls that the EU Strategy Against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, which was adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003 defines as one of its objectives increasing the physical security of nuclear material and other radioactive substances. Measures designed to achieve that objective will, at the same time, contribute to the prevention of potential acts of nuclear (and radiological) terrorism.</p>
<p>Possibilities to support the activities undertaken in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear security action plan are currently under discussion in relevant Council fora. This could lead to the financing of projects aimed at strengthening the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, securing/dismantling radio-active sources in non-nuclear applications (i.e. for agricultural, industrial and medical purposes), and, combating the illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and radioactive substances. The projects would be implemented by the IAEA in selected countries which are in need of such assistance, e.g. those which are part of the wider neighbourhood of the EU.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, the EU is carrying out démarches to third countries with the objective of encouraging them to apply the most recent standards set by the IAEA concerning the safety and security of highly radioactive sources.</p>
<p>The European Council, in its conclusions of 25 March 2004, welcomed the political commitment of the Member States and of the acceding States, taken as of now, to act jointly against terrorists acts, in the spirit of the Solidarity Clause contained in Article 42 of the draft Constitution for Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council invites the Honourable Parliamentarian to refer to the European Council declaration on combating terrorism, adopted on the same day, in which the Union and the Member States pledge to do everything within their power to combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Union, the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations set out under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001).</p>
<p>As part of the declaration, among the European Union strategic objectives to combat terrorism, figures out the deepening of the international consensus and the enhancing of international efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
<p>This objective includes, inter alia, to work to ensure universal adherence to, and full implementation of, the United Nations Conventions on Terrorism, and to agree a Comprehensive UN Convention against Terrorism as well as a comprehensive UN Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0171"></a>

Financial assistance may be provided for both pupil and teacher mobility, including project-related mobility and language exchanges.</p>
<p>According to the Commission's recent communication on the new generation of programmes in education and training after 2006, the Comenius action would be retained and that a level of participation of 10% of pupils in joint educational activities such as partnerships and mobility is proposed as a target.

<p>The Declaration stresses the decisive role that the legislative framework created by the European Union for the purpose of combating terrorism and improving judicial cooperation has to play in combating terrorist activities. The European Council has urged the Member States to take any measures that remain necessary to fully implement, by June 2004, certain legislative measures that were adopted in this field. Among the measures listed are the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant, the Framework Decision on Joint investigation Teams and the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism. Member States are also called upon to ratify the three protocols to the Europol Convention by December 2004.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council was instructed to examine measures such as the retention of communication traffic data by service providers and exchanges of information on convictions for terrorist offences with a view to adoption by June 2005.</p>
<p>The European Council also emphasised the need for measures in the field of border controls and document security such as incorporation of biometric features into passports and visas and the creation of an integrated system for the exchange of information on stolen and lost passports having recourse to the SIS and Interpol database.</p>
<p>The position of a co-ordinator on terrorism was also established. The co-ordinator, Mr. Gjis de Vries, commenced work on 29 March 2004 and appeared before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Freedom and Security on 6 April 2004.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council, mandated by the European Council in December 2003, has together with the Commission, drawn up an assessment report on all aspects of the Union's relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>One of the main conclusions of this assessment was that the EU needs to emphasise the importance of the respect for shared values for the EU-Russia relationship. The European Council, at its meeting in Brussels on 25/26 March 2004, reaffirmed the Union's strong and genuine interest in an open, stable and democratic Russia. In this respect it welcomed President Putin's stated commitment to build up and strengthen a multiparty system, to develop civil society and to make every effort to ensure freedom of the press.</p>
<p>Such a statement had already been made in the Presidency declaration on the Presidential elections in Russia of 17 March this year, the EU welcomed the preliminary findings of the OSCE/ODIHR international electoral observation mission on the Presidential elections in Russia. The EU noted however, that these findings stated that the State-controlled media displayed a clear bias in favour of the incumbent and that the authorities failed to attempt to rectify this situation during the campaign.</p>
<p>The Council intends accordingly to follow the development of media freedom in Russia closely as part of its comprehensive political dialogue with this strategic partner. The Council would point out that the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council will meet on 27 April with a view to agreeing upon the provisional agenda for the forthcoming EU/Russia summit. In consequence it would be premature at this point to comment in advance this provisional agenda.

<p>(EN) The EU is firmly committed to Afghanistan's development and reconstruction and remains one of the leading donors. At the Tokyo Conference in January 2002, the Commission and EU Member States pledged more than 2.1 billion € in support of the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. These promises have not only been fulfilled, but disbursements are actually higher than the initial pledges. Taking into account the most recent indicative figures for 2004, Commission and EU Member States have committed more than 2.3 billion € since Tokyo.</p>
<p>At the recent International Conference on Afghanistan in Berlin, 31 March - 1 April 2004, Commission and EU Member States pledged to provide approximately 700 million € to Afghanistan in 2004. This pledge is a signal of the strong commitment of the EU to the future political stability and development of Afghanistan. The total amount pledged at the conference was 6,75 billion € over a three year period.</p>
<p>President Karzai announced at the conference that elections will be held in September 2004. € 30 million of the EU pledge will be allocated to support the election process, following the Commission’s announcement on 2 March that it was increasing its support for electoral registration by € 8 million to € 15 million.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as the Honourable Member of Parliament rightly points out, tackling the drugs trade remains one of Afghanistan's greatest challenges. Afghanistan will return to peace and prosperity only if the drugs trade is eliminated. The drugs economy in Afghanistan cannot be treated separately from efforts to restore security and improve governance. The EU fully supports the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy. It is vital that the international community and the Afghan people work together to achieve success. The Council welcomes and fully supports the Berlin Declaration on Counter-Narcotics, signed on 1 April 2004 by Afghanistan and all neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>There are no overnight solutions. No single project can address the variety of factors that influence farmers to grow poppy crops. We need a range of different interventions to promote alternative livelihoods for farmers. We must improve the size and co-ordination of our interventions.</p>
<p>Equally important are investments to build up the effectiveness of the drug enforcement effort.

<p>(EN) The Council would like to emphasise at first that it is of course for the institutions and citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina themselves to change their country's constitution should they wish.</p>
<p>Methods for constitutional change are defined by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitution (Annex 4 of the General Framework Agreement for Peace) itself. Providing the legal means to change the Constitution is one of the strengths of the Dayton Peace Agreement. We have already witnessed constitutional change in this regard. Last year Bosnia-Herzegovina's Parliament chose to change their own constitution in order to comply with EU and NATO (Partnership for Peace) requirements through expert commissions, led by international experts but staffed by Bosnia-Herzegovina experts, which were established by the High Representative and EU Special Representative, Paddy Ashdown.</p>
<p>These constitutional changes demonstrate that the people, politicians and institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina are prepared to support even the most difficult reforms if they clearly help to achieve Bosnia-Herzegovina's ambitions for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to support EU Special Representative Ashdown in his strategy of replacing the push of the Dayton powers with the pull of European integration as the key driver of reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0187"></a>

<p>(EN) The framework for the introduction of International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS) into European legislation is set by Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which - for the adoption of individual standards - provides for the "Comitology" procedure leading to Commission regulations.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member of Parliament is fully aware, the International Accounting Standard 32 (IAS 32) had been excluded from the adoption of the majority of IAS by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1725/2003 of 29 September 2003,<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> awaiting a revision of IAS 32 (among other standards) by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).</p>
<p>The IASB finished its revision work in December 2003 and published the revised IAS 32 shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The classification of co-operative share capital as pointed out by the Honourable Member in her question is one of the central points, but not the only issue where the Accounting Regulatory Committee is currently examining carefully whether the revised standard is fully satisfactory in the European context. In this regard, however, it seems to be useful to mention the possibility of interpretations of international accounting standards or similar guidance issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).</p>
<p>Given the clear distribution of competencies and the fact that the work in the Accounting Regulatory Committee is ongoing, the Council is at this stage not in a position to express any views on the outcome of this process and the time-frame within which the remaining open questions will be solved.</p>
<p>However, the Council can take the opportunity of pointing out that, when considering the approval of a single IAS or a set of IAS, all relevant parties are bound by Regulation No. 1606/2002, which clearly states that international accounting standards can only be adopted within the European Union, if they are - among other criteria- conducive to the European public good.</p>
<p>It should furthermore be noted that the Council is not in a position to comment on any decisions taken by authorities from third countries when deciding on the coherence of their own existing systems with the work of the fully independent body IASB.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is certainly aware, the acquis on the freedom of movement for persons will apply as from the date of accession, subject to specific transitional arrangements as set out in the Act of Accession.</p>
<p>Under these arrangements, by way of derogation from Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) N° 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community and until the end of a two year period following the date of accession, the present Member States will apply national measures, or those resulting from bilateral agreements, regulating access to their labour markets by nationals from acceding States (other than Cyprus and Malta). Depending on how liberal these national measures are, they may or may not result in full access to labour markets. However, under the "standstill clause", the present Member States cannot make access to their labour markets more restrictive than it was on the date of signature of the Accession Treaty, on 16 April 2003.</p>
<p>The present Member States may continue to apply such measures until the end of a five-year period following the date of accession, subject to notification to the Commission by those Member States concerned no later than at the end of the two-year period following the date of accession. These transitional arrangements may be prolonged for a further two years if serious disturbances of the labour market or a threat of such disruption appeared.</p>
<p>The Council is not aware of any proposals from the Commission aimed at introducing changes to the current EU legal framework applicable to the free movement of persons in the context of the Accession Treaty. As for the dissemination of information, as the Honourable Member is certainly aware, it will be up to the Commission to ensure the necessary transparency of the applicable rules. In this respect, the Commission has announced that it will take a number of initiatives, including making the relevant information available to all citizens via the EURES Internet Job portal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0196"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission’s Communication on Health and Poverty Reduction in developing countries sets out a comprehensive set of policies and strategies for improving the health outcomes of poor people in developing countries and hence achieving the Millennium Development Goals that relate to health. It aims specifically to help developing countries to develop dynamic, responsive and sustainable health systems that are capable of responding effectively to the myriad of health and health-related challenges that they face.</p>
<p>In order to achieve its aims the Commission is working to make the delivery of EC’s aid as effective as possible. To this end it is cooperating closely with the Member States and other donors to strengthen the harmonisation of policies and aid modalities for better health outcomes, with a particular focus on the development of sector wide approaches in health.</p>
<p>The Commission chose to highlight certain poverty-related diseases – notably HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis – as being of high priority to us, because of the particular severity of the threat they pose to global health and the potential added value of certain Community actions in the fight against them. It does not intend to develop further specific initiatives related to the fight against particular diseases or conditions, except in certain very special cases such as the global campaign to eradicate polio.</p>
<p>In general, it believes that better health in developing countries will be best achieved and sustained through the provision of general or sector budget support linked to strong policy dialogue with the country concerned. This will be aimed both at providing flexible support for strong and responsive health systems, and at ensuring adequate investment in other sectors which impact on health, such as water and sanitation, education, and so on.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0190"></a>

<p>In the last two years, the European Parliament has voted in favour of appropriations intended to finance pilot projects to combat poverty-related diseases other than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis (EU Budget 2003 – € 1 million, EU Budget 2004 – € 3 million). In spite of the commitment made by the international community in 2000 to reduce by two thirds the mortality rate among children under five by 2015 (Millennium Development Goal number 4), UNICEF report that in 2003 a quarter of the world’s children still had no protection from vaccine-preventable diseases. At a time when epidemics spread faster and further than before, health interdependence between different regions of the world has deepened, and immunisation in one country can be the key to reduction of disease in others.</p>
<p>In light of this worrying situation, does the European Commission intend to renew and expand these appropriations in the preliminary draft budget for 2005 and beyond?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has provided €4 million to the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) through grants made under the provisions of the special budget line for poverty diseases other than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The funding was provided as a pilot project in 2003 and 2004. There is no legal basis for this budget line and the budgetary rules do not allow for provision of any further funding in 2005 or 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is, however, currently negotiating with relevant parties a package of support for a number of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries for the global polio eradication initiative. This is a special situation where the global community is aiming to eradicate a specific disease, and achievement of high immunisation rates in all countries at the same time is particularly important.</p>
<p>In the long term the Commission believes that the only way to ensure continued high rates of protection against vaccine-preventable diseases will be through the development of sustainable programmes for childhood immunisation by developing countries themselves, as an element of a comprehensive package of interventions for the prevention and treatment of childhood illness.</p>
<p>In this context, the aim is to move to providing support for the health sector as a whole rather than for specific health projects. Where such a sector wide approach is in place the Commission highlights the importance of immunisation in its dialogue with national authorities. In those ACP countries where the Commission is providing general budget support, immunisation coverage rates are frequently selected as one of the performance indicators in the health sector for determining the size of the variable tranche.</p>
<p>Positive results are being seen from this approach. For example, in Mozambique, where the Commission is providing both general budget support and sector support, a national household survey last year found that immunisation coverage improved significantly for all childhood vaccines compared to 1997. Infant mortality fell from 149 to 101 per 1000 live births over the same period, which is a truly remarkable achievement.</p>

<p>(EN) There are very strict and well established mechanisms put in place by ECHO (the service of the European Commission responsible for humanitarian aid) in order to ensure that the aid delivered by its partner organisations actually reaches the intended beneficiaries. Partners work on the basis of a list of beneficiaries, which is established after an assessment of the household's economy and needs. The aid is delivered directly to these beneficiaries, without intermediary, which allows the Commission to ensure that the people who are on the lists do receive what they are entitled to.</p>
<p>In Chechnya ECHO continues to assist the most vulnerable people as much as access and security will allow. Due to lack of security, the population in the south parts of Chechnya is certainly less covered by ECHO assistance.</p>
<p>ECHO, through its implementing partners, continues to support and deliver humanitarian aid in Ingushetia (through water &amp; sanitation, temporary shelter, educational and protection activities as well as psychological and medical care provided to the Chechen Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) living in tented camps, in spontaneous settlements or in private accommodation). ECHO also finances the distribution of food aid to Chechen IDPs in Dagestan.</p>
<p>Despite the significantly increased pressure on IDPs to return to Chechnya, with the closure of four more tented camps in the last few months, and the fact that Non-Governmental Organizations experience many problems in obtaining the authorisation to build decent alternative shelter for those who do not want to return to Chechnya, the protection of Chechen IDPs in Ingushetia remains an issue of great concern to the EC. The full respect of the principle of voluntary return entails that people who do not want to return to Chechnya yet because of the insecurity and the lack of decent living conditions there should be allowed to stay displaced in Ingushetia.</p>
<p>70%, of the 2003 ECHO budget (26 M€) for the Northern Caucasus, was earmarked for humanitarian aid to Chechnya and 30% to Ingushetia and Dagestan.</p>

<p>(EN) Globalisation creates opportunities for sustained economic growth and the development of the world economy but also challenges for sustainable development. Global market liberalisation has a key role to play in supporting the integration of developing countries into the world economy. However, the Commission recognises that the process of adjustment in the short-term can impose social costs in certain countries and sectors, in terms of unemployment and wage losses. The liberalisation of product, capital and labour markets results in changing economic structures, relative prices and consumption patterns. There exists the risk that competitive advantage will be sought through an artificial reduction of costs, for example, through the erosion of labour and environmental standards, or through protectionism. One should also recognise that globalisation could have negative impacts on the environment in as far as it increases pressure on natural resources and the environment in general.</p>
<p>The challenge is to manage the process of globalisation, in order to maximise its benefits, mitigate the social costs of adjustment and tackle its environmental impacts.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2004, the Commission welcomed the final report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation. The Commission believes that the EU should seek to reinforce global governance through an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach, while rejecting protectionist reactions. It will carefully analyse the recommendations and proposals made in the report of the World Commission, and is currently preparing a Communication on the social dimension of globalisation, as a contribution to the follow-up process on the report.</p>
<p>Independently, the Commission has, in its 2001 Communication, Promoting Core Labour Standards and Improving Social Governance in the Context of Globalisation<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, already set out its approach to globalisation and social development. Finally, and more recently, the Commission also issued a communication on the follow-up to the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. It takes stock of EU action to promote sustainable development both within the EU and at the global level, including what are the initiatives taken at EU level to reinforce synergies between trade and sustainable development<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission is a strong advocate of the protection of core labour rights and promotion of environmental standards at all levels. In its view, this should not play against the comparative advantages of Developing Countries and more efforts should be done to help DCs benefit from additional market access on products where they have such a comparative advantage, including environmentally friendly products. In order to achieve a sustainable development, there is a need to address trade, investment, growth, social development and environmental protection in an integrated and mutually supportive manner, while avoiding any abuse of the linkages between these issues for protectionist purposes,</p>
<p>The EU has in place a number of positive policies to promote sustainable development. With respect to trade, the EU Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) provides market access on a preferential basis to developing countries. The current GSP scheme provides a positive social and environmental incentive scheme, whereby compliance with core labour standards or internationally acknowledged environmental standards qualifies a beneficiary country for additional trade preferences. The scheme also allows for a temporary withdrawal of preferences, where beneficiary countries incur a serious or systematic violation of any standards referred to in the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work, such as, for example, any form of slavery or forced labour.</p>
<p>By promoting Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) the Commission seeks to encourage business to focus not only on economic development, but on the social and environmental impacts of its activities. In a development context this can have a dramatic impact on improving working conditions, eliminating poverty and better addressing associated environmental impacts, as duly recognised in the World Summit on Sustainable Development’s (WSSD) Plan of implementation. The Commission has taken a number of initiatives to promote CSR globally. It established a European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on CSR to facilitate exchange of experience and explore the need for a common approach and guiding principles for CSR. The Commission also actively supports key global CSR instruments, notably the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These contain voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct in a wide range of areas of company activity. The Commission increasingly aims to build references to the Guidelines and other international CSR instruments into agreements with third countries (eg EU-Chile Association Agreement; and the agreement under negotiation with Mercosur). At the same time, the Commission recognises that further efforts are needed to improve transparency and accountability of CSR initiatives.</p>
<p>The “Fair Trade” movement can make a genuine contribution to sustainable development and poverty reduction, and the EU is supportive of such efforts, in particular, through awareness-raising projects. However, Fair Trade remains a niche market, and our recognition of its benefits for a small minority of traders should not diminish the Commission’s effort to help developing countries to get the most out of trade in general. The Commission is working towards better mainstreaming of trade issues into development policies and, more generally, helping Developing Countries move towards a sustainable development, through combined technical assistance efforts, notably in the trade, economic, social development and environmental field. . In the framework of Community Development Cooperation Policy, the EC is also addressing the constraints and challenges which globalisation poses for developing countries in different areas, including by focussing on social development and economic reforms.</p>
<p>In 1999, the Commission introduced the policy of Sustainability Impact Assessment for every major trade negotiation in which the EU is involved. The main purpose of Sustainability Impact Assessment is to assess the economic, social and environmental impacts of trade liberalisation, with a view to better addressing the linkages between the different pillars of Sustainable development and helping policy-makers design the policy mix to mitigate the negative impacts of trade liberalisation, and to enhance the positive impacts. A key aspect of the Sustainability Impact Assessment process is the consultation of stakeholders in civil society. The Commission is currently conducting a review of the methodology for Sustainability Impact Assessment, in order to improve the quality of assessments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Stability and Growth Pact has been in the news in recent months, among other reasons because of the position adopted by the Council of Ministers regarding the continuing budget deficits recorded by France and Germany. There can clearly be no stability without (sustainable) growth and public finances that are sustainable in the long term. It would therefore appear sensible to make the amendments to the Stability and Growth Pact needed to bring it into line with cyclical developments and with the Lisbon Strategy for sustainable growth and development.</p>

<p>There is indeed a need to combine stricter discipline with flexibility in the conduct of national budgetary policies. This can be achieved by, among other things, (i) putting more emphasis on public debt and sustainability, (ii) being particularly strict at the time when the economy is booming and thereby applying more symmetry in budgetary surveillance over the economic cycle, (iii) making more allowance for country-specific differences without putting at risk the equal treatment principle, and (iv) by setting principles for prescribing the budgetary adjustment path and ensuring stronger enforcement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has proposed to allocate an amount equivalent to 0.41% of the GNI of the EU27 (which equates to 0.46% before the transfers to the proposed single rural and fisheries instruments) in support of cohesion policy. This percentage corresponds to EUR 336.3 billion over the period, which represents an increase of funding compared to the period 2000-2006 of 26%. On current estimates, some 78% of this would go to the poorest Member States and regions eligible for the purposed convergence programmes developed regions and the “statistical effect” regions in the current as well as the new Member States. The convergence programmes would include the regions affected by the statistical effect of enlargement with a level of support that “would be higher that decided in Berlin in 1999 for the so-called “phasing out” regions of the current generation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0140"></a>

<p>One of the Commission’s most important priorities for 2004 and 2005 is the review of regional State Aid control rules for the period after 2006. In its review, the Commission will have to consider various and partially conflicting policy objectives: the traditional objective of economic and social cohesion, the competitiveness objective and the competition policy objective. The Commission will have to find a formula that allows State Aid policy to contribute to economic and social cohesion at European level and offers more flexibility for competitiveness-oriented policies, while at the same time reducing overall volumes of aid.</p>
<p>As far as low population density areas are concerned, no substantial change as compared to the present situation is envisaged at this stage of reflection. Low population density areas are likely to continue to be eligible for regional aid, including aid to offset additional transport costs that affect the economic activity in the regions concerned. Furthermore, the Commission, aware of the continued depopulation that the most arctic regions are suffering from, is examining whether other types of aid can be authorised where such aid is necessary to stop depopulation, provided that the aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) With regard to the judgement of the Court of Justice on case C-24/00, the Commission concluded that the Court did not take a position on the maximum level of caffeine contained in “energy drinks” or the presence in these drinks of taurine and glucoronolactone, but rather the Commission had not provided evidences at this stage to call into question the French policy based on the scientific opinions mentioned by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>In accordance with current Community legislation on the labelling of foodstuffs the above substances, if used as ingredients, must be indicated in the list of ingredients. In addition, in order to take into account the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF), Directive 2002/67/EC of 18 July 2002, on the labelling of foodstuffs containing quinine and of foodstuffs containing caffeine, imposes a warning and the indication of the caffeine content for beverages containing more than 150mg/l of caffeine. The Member States have to prohibit trade in products which do not comply with this Directive as of 1 July 2004. Consequently, the Commission does not consider that further labelling requirements are necessary.</p>

The proposed Regulation aims to harmonise divergent national rules concerning the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods in order to ensure a high level of consumer protection and the free circulation of goods within the Community. This text establishes a positive list of vitamins and minerals that may be added to food and lays out a procedure that would allow the regulation or, imposition of conditions on, or prohibition of, the use in foods of certain substances, such as those mentioned by the Honourable Member, following consultations with the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p>Regarding the presence of certain ingredients in food supplements, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that Directive 2002/46/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements lays down specific rules for the use of vitamins and minerals as ingredients in food supplements. Specific rules to harmonise the use of other ingredients in food supplements such as ephedrine alkaloids may be proposed at a later stage. Until then, the use of these substances is subject to national rules, without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaty. The Commission intends to raise the United States ban on food supplements containing ephedrine with the Member States in the near future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On a number of occasions, the European Parliament has expressed its wish that the Council should appoint a special representative for Tibet. The budget appropriations for such a post have been allocated twice. The EU already has special representatives for Macedonia, the Middle East, the Southern Caucasus, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, as well as a special envoy for the Great Lakes region of Africa. As in these cases, a special EU representative for Tibet would be able to actively promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict, inter alia by supporting the dialogue which has been in progress for more than a year between representatives of the Beijing government and of the Dalai Lama. The fear expressed in a reply to a similar question by Mr Newton Dunn (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0828_EN.html">H-0828/03</a>) in January 2004<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that a special EU representative would be able neither to visit Tibet nor to meet representatives of the Beijing government has not been substantiated in any way.</p>
<p>Why will the Commission not heed the European Parliament's clearly expressed wish in this case and appoint a special EU representative for Tibet, as has been done for seven other regions of conflict in Europe, Africa and Asia?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission, while not opposing in principle the concept of Special Representative for Tibet, must express doubts as to whether the appointment of such a Representative would bring any added value to the present situation where regular channels of communication already exist between China and the EU, notably within the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights. It also wonders whether such a Representative could positively contribute to the fragile process now underway between Beijing and the Representatives of the Dalai-Lama (something which the EU has encouraged over the years).</p>
<p>Moreover, as mentioned in several instances, the Commission takes the view that a Special Representative would most likely be prevented by China from playing an effective role on the ground. In this respect, it appears that, while she has already been three times to China, the US Special Co-ordinator for Tibetan Affairs has thus far not been granted a visa to Tibet.</p>
<p>Finally, as already explained to the Parliament during the 2003 budget procedure, the Commission would like to underline that it is not up to the Commission to decide on the appointment of a Special Representative for Tibet. According to Article 18(5) of the Treaty on the European Union such a decision belongs to the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The agenda drawn up in Lisbon, as well as in Gothenburg, has been unanimously agreed by all Member States; it is seen as the best approach for Union to achieve sustainable growth in the future. The agenda represents a comprehensive programme of action. As the Commission made clear in its report to the Spring Council in January 2004<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, this programme is only partially implemented at the Community level. Member States have a very large responsibility for implementing these commitments, and “numerous reforms and investments, which are the responsibility of the Member States, have yet to be achieved.</p>
<p>Specific Community level support to regions is offered under EU cohesion policy. In Ireland, specific attention is devoted to the Border, Midland and Western region which, until 2006, is eligible for Objective 1 of the Structural Funds. As such it has been allocated €195 per head per year for the 2000-2006 period (1999 prices), for measures designed to improve competitiveness. Since the mid-1990s, the Border, Midland and Western region has experienced the second highest growth rate of all equivalent regions in the current Member States.</p>
<p>In addition, the whole of Ireland was eligible for support under the Cohesion Fund (until 1 January 2004), which allocated €556 million to the Member State as a whole, for projects in the fields of transport infrastructure and the environment.</p>
<p>For the next period after 2006, the Commission has presented new proposals for the reform of cohesion policy in the Third Report on economic and social cohesion<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Under the Commission’s proposals for the reform of cohesion policy, the Border, Midland and Western region would be eligible for support under a new generation of Regional competitiveness and employment programmes.</p>
<p>The new programmes would seek to consolidate the achievements of the current period, with an emphasis on investment in innovation and the knowledge-based economy, accessibility and the environment and risk prevention.

<p>In this respect, the Commission has taken the following initiatives:</p>
<p>Commission Protection: the Commission has amended its internal rules by a Commission decision (C/2001/3031 of 29 November 2001) to complement these rules by security provisions. This decision complements the decision (C1995/1510) already taken.</p>
<p>Data protection within the Institutions: The Commission is implementing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data.</p>
<p>As proposed by the Commission, Directive 2002/58/EC of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector was adopted by the Council and the Parliament.</p>
<p>The establishment of a European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA): the Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing ENISA entered into force on 14th March 2004. The ENISA budget amounts to € 33,3 million (EU 25) for the period 2004-2008. The Commission is actively preparing the establishment of the ENISA and it expects that the Management Board can be convoked for a first meeting in July 2004 and that the Executive Director will be nominated before the summer break.</p>
<p>Research: the effort made by the Commission continues. Following the 6 Research and Technological Development Framework Programme (FP) 1<span class="sup">st</span> call for proposals, 14 projects were selected in the area of network security for an amount of roughly € 70 million. The effort on cryptology in particular continues with the ECRYPT project, which follows on the 5<span class="sup">th</span> FP NESSIE project. A further call for proposals in this area will be made in 2005.</p>
<p>Preparatory action for security research: the Commission has launched this Preparatory Action in view of a full Security Research Programme as from 2007. Five priority missions have been identified in the Communication from the Commission with one in the area of network security aiming at “optimising security and protection of networked systems”. Another priority mission deals with the interoperability and integration of information and communication systems. Other priorities deal with situation awareness, protection against terrorism and crisis management. The first call was published on 31 March 2004 and work will start before the end of 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0155"></a>

<p>(EN) The reprocessing plant in Sellafield/Cumbria is a so-called “bulk handling facility”, in which the nuclear material is processed in loose form, such as liquid or powder. Generally, in such facilities measurement uncertainties and particular features of the process lead to differences between the book inventory and the physical inventory. An inventory difference does not hence correspond automatically to a physical removal of nuclear material.</p>
<p>The Commission evaluates these differences for all bulk handling facilities of the EU and seeks for explanations whenever necessary. According to the information available to the Commission and based on its evaluations it was concluded that there was no evidence that Plutonium was diverted from the intended use in the mentioned facility.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern expressed by HM’s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) as to the situation regarding the storage of Magnox fuel, legacy wastes and residues and welcomes and supports the initiatives taken by the NII in this context.</p>
<p>The Commission issued on 30 March 2004 a Directive calling upon the United Kingdom Government to ensure that all measures be taken by BNFL in Sellafield, in order to bring a long lasting infringement (legacy from the 1950’s) to the safeguards provisions to an end. The Directive imposes on the United Kingdom the obligation to submit to the Commission, before 1<span class="sup">st</span> June 2004, a comprehensive plan in order to bring such infringement to an end. Furthermore, the United Kingdom should present to the Commission every 6 months a progress report on its implementation. On the basis of these reports and its own verifications, the Commission will assess the compliance of the United Kingdom with the obligations set out in the directive.</p>
<p>The Commission continues inspecting the Sellafield site under the provisions of both chapter VII and chapter III of the Euratom Treaty. With regard to the need of verifying the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of this Treaty, a verification has taken place during the week from 8 to 12 March 2004.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to recall that it has proposed a new set of measures (the so called "nuclear package") in order to provide the EU with a global community approach to nuclear safety and to reinforce security of supplies.

<p>Swedish Customs has decided to close down a number of customs houses in Sweden on the grounds that the enlargement of the EU in 2004 will result in the disappearance of certain tasks in the import/export field and that this, in conjunction with significant financial losses, will necessarily entail redundancies.</p>
<p>This decision means that Swedish Customs is laying off staff and abandoning the permanent manning of the following ten arrival points in Sweden for travellers from outside the Schengen area and outside the EU itself: Gäddede, Gävle, Halmstad, Kalmar, Lidköping, Skavsta, Sturup, Visby, Vittjärn and Västerås. Several of these places have important and expanding airports (in particular Västerås and Stockholm Skavsta outside Nyköping), or major ports (e.g. Gävle, Västerås and Halmstad) or are responsible for guarding long sections of the border (e.g. Gäddede and Vittjärn).</p>
<p>With such an extensive reduction in Sweden's overseeing of its own and the Union's external borders, it is not difficult to see that there is a greater risk of an increase in the smuggling of drugs and arms and of illegal immigration into the EU as a whole.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that, despite such extensive closures, Sweden meets its obligations to uphold the Schengen Agreement and the Union's external borders?

<p>With regard to persons, it should be noted that border controls between new and current Member States will not be abolished on 1<span class="sup">st</span> May 2004.

Border controls on persons between new and current Member States will only be abolished following a unanimous Council decision and after verifying, through specific evaluation missions, the preparedness of the new Member States to fully apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis and to effectively control their external borders.</p>
<p>As regards Sweden, its capacity to carry out effective controls at its external borders, in conformity with the Schengen acquis, has been thoroughly evaluated through a number of evaluation missions in 2000, prior to the Council decision enabling Sweden and the other Nordic countries to join the Schengen area as from 25 March 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0168"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the Honourable Members about the problem of child pornography distributed through the Internet.</p>
<p>There is need for continuous efforts to combat harmful and illegal content on the Internet based on international co-operation amongst governments, particularly law enforcement and judicial authorities, but also between governments and the Internet industry, dedicated hotlines and non-governmental organisations to effectively tackle this horrifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for dealing with illegal content (including child pornography) is with the appropriate law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Member States of the EU, which co-operate internationally in the fight against child pornography on the Internet through the existing channels of communications, such as Europol and Interpol.</p>
<p>The EU has been a forerunner in the fight against illegal and harmful content since 1996, with an approach agreed unanimously by the Parliament and the Council. The Safer Internet Action Plan adopted by the Council and the Parliament in 1999<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is a major element in the Commission’s activity in this field. It provides funding for a European network of hotlines allowing users to report illegal content, including child pornography.</p>
<p>The EU strategy to combat child pornography also consists of legal instruments and practical measures against computer crime and child pornography. These include the Council Framework Decision on approximation of laws and sanctions in the field of sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and the Council Recommendation of September 1998 on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity<a href="#defann_46_3" name="refann_46_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Council Decision of May 2000 to combat child pornography on the Internet<a href="#defann_46_4" name="refann_46_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>On 22 December 2003, the Council adopted the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation and child pornography. As far as sexual exploitation is concerned the act aims first of all at penalising those, who bring children into prostitution or pornographic performances or who profit from such activities. But also those who engage in sexual activities with a child shall be punished, where, for example, the child was coerced or a payment was given for the child's sexual services or where a position of trust, authority or influence was abused.</p>
<p>Offences concerning child pornography concern a variety of acts such as the production, distribution, dissemination, transmission, supplying, acquisition or possession of the material concerned.</p>
<p>Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the sexual abuse of children and specific acts linked to child pornography are punishable by criminal penalties of at least between 1 and 3 years of imprisonment. Penalties of a maximum of at least between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment shall be introduced for offences committed in aggravated circumstances.</p>
<p>The Framework Decision requires higher penalties for a variety of cases involving children below the age of sexual consent. On the other hand, the Council was not able to agree on a common definition concerning the age of sexual consent and the Framework Decision simply refers to national law.</p>
<p>As an example the Commission would like to mention that at the beginning of this year, the final version of the “International Child Exploitation Database” feasibility study has been received, which has been co-funded under the STOP II Programme and run by a project group composed by experts from several Member States. The project group has issued various recommendations, especially recommending that a sophisticated networked international child sexual exploitation image database, building on the fledgling system at Interpol, be urgently required. Such a database, being both technically and legally possible, would have to take into account the different national laws governing images of child sexual exploitation and protection of personal data.</p>
<p>The Commission is not responsible for the actual setting up of such an international database as this is left to the appreciation of the EU Member States and other involved Countries. The Commission is currently supporting an effort made by several Member States, Europol and other third Countries under the AGIS programme for funding an implementation study as a concrete follow-up to the above mentioned feasibility study.</p>
<p>It aims at preparing the establishment of a sophisticated networked international database of child-pornography on-line images. The database will be an effective tool for law enforcement in identifying victims and offenders of child sexual exploitation on-line around the world. It will reduce the international duplication of effort and increase international co-operation in achieving these goals.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the proposed database will have a major impact on the effective policing of this horrendous crime by improving the exchange of information, reducing duplication and significantly raising the analytical capacity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The special European Council held on 21 September 2001 adopted an inter-disciplinary Plan of Action to Combat Terrorism. More recently, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Madrid, the European Council of 25 March adopted a Declaration on Combating Terrorism that calls for a number of future measures to enhance the fight against terrorism and for the effective implementation of existing instruments and optimum use of existing EU bodies. The European Council also agreed upon a number of updated Strategic Objectives to enhance the European Union Action to Combat Terrorism.</p>
<p>In a Commission paper on terrorism providing input for the European Council the Commission proposed various types of action that the Union could take in response to the attacks in Madrid. Amongst them was the need for a better implementation of existing legislative instruments relevant to the fight against terrorism and the adoption of draft measures already on the Council table. The Commission believes that the Union has already put in place a series of legislative measures to combat terrorism but that the implementation of such measures is often slow and inadequate. A Commission report on the implementation on the Framework Decision on money laundering and the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime was adopted the 5 April. A report on the implementation of the Framework Decision on combating terrorism will follow.</p>
<p>As regards future measures, the Commission is proactively engaged in the identification of further actions within the Declaration that require particular attention and is also continuing its work on proposals that will provide added value to the fight against terrorism (e.g. a future Communication on the establishment of a European Information Policy for law enforcement authorities or a proposal for the establishment of an European Register on convictions and disqualifications). In line with this, the Commission has just adopted a Communication on measures to be taken to combat terrorism and other forms of serious crime, in particular to improve exchanges of information, accompanied by a Proposal for a Council Decision on the exchange of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0174"></a>

<p>(EN) Media freedom is a defining characteristic of functioning democracies and is a key element underpinning the EU/Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>For several years, the Commission has been concerned that media freedom has been undermined in Russia. These concerns have been raised repeatedly in political dialogue with the Russian authorities. The EU has also made several declarations of concern. Unfortunately, the most recent events, including the refusal of Russia to provide a visa for an EU foreign correspondent, have not been encouraging. In particular, international observation missions of the Office of Democratic Institution and Human Rights (ODIHR) reported that both the Duma and Presidential elections failed to meet Organisation on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) commitments concerning access to state controlled media.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken good note of the recent statement of President Putin that he will ensure media freedom, which it welcomes.</p>
<p>One observation is that a free media cannot be created overnight, but that the Commission expect the Russian authorities to put in place the right conditions to foster media freedom. The Commission, for its part, will continue to support the development of an independent and pluralistic media in Russia, for example via projects funded by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and Tacis.</p>
<p>The Commission firmly believes that the EU should hold open and frank dialogue with Russia on the values to which Russia is committed as a member of the OSCE and Council of Europe, such as respect for human rights and media freedom. It is ready to do so, and will closely follow developments in Russia, including the implementation in practice of President Putin’s recent statement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0192"></a>

<p>In 1999, I asked the Commission<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> about the need to speed up the evaluation of imidacloprid given its potential implication in the high mortality rate among bees in France next to sunflower fields treated with ‘Gaucho’. In 2002, the Commission replied to a question by Dominique F.C. Souchet<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the potential toxicity of fipronil and imidacloprid for bees: ‘The Commission has not so far received any scientific information on similar problems in other Member States.’ In the meantime, the situation has worsened. In Belgium, there has been a decline in the bee population near ‘Gaucho’ maize crops and near rape crops planted in fields where ‘Gaucho’ beetroot or cereal crops had been grown previously. According to the information available to me, serious reductions in bee numbers have also been recorded in other Member States (in particular, Germany, Sweden and Northern Ireland). The disappearance of bees clearly represents a serious threat to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Faced with this alarming state of affairs, what prevents the Commission from calling for the evaluation of imidacloprid and fipronil during the first stage of evaluation of existing active substances under Directive 91/414/EEC<a href="#defann_53_3" name="refann_53_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>?

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member is invited to refer also to the replies given to Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2004-0691_EN.html">E-0691/04</a> (Mr. Dominique Souchet) and Petition 488/00 (Mrs. Mary Paulette) relating to the same subject.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully aware of reports about an increased mortality of honeybees in certain regions of France.</p>
<p>Beekeepers allege that two phytopharmaceutical substances, fipronil and imidacloprid are the principal cause of the mortality. Other circles voice that this causal link is far from being certain and claim that a large variety of possibly interacting factors might be at the source of this phenomenon. This was also recognised by this Parliament in its recent resolution on the problems faced by the beekeeping sector.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Commission awaits the outcome of a number of investigations that are being currently undertaken in France as well as the Community evaluations of the two substances. It also has forwarded the relevant information to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which is responsible for performing the risk assessment for both substances.</p>
<p>As to the measures taken by the French authorities, the marketing conditions of these substances, pending a Community Decision on them, are subject to a transitional derogation during which national rules continue to apply. This transitional regime is explicitly authorised by Article 8 of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 on the placing of plant protection products on the market<a href="#defann_53_4" name="refann_53_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As the safety evaluation is not yet finalised and no Community harmonisation has taken place, the Commission is not in a position to propose measures at this time.</p>
<p>Should it become clear that the substances pose an unacceptable direct or indirect risk to non-target species, a category which expressly includes honeybees and their larvae, or fail to meet any other requirements necessary for ensuring a safe use, the Commission would then formally propose the non-inclusion of the substances in Annex I ("Active substances for incorporation in plant protection products") of the above Directive. The practical consequences of such non-inclusion are the banning of the substances from the EU market.</p>
<p>The Commission understands that the Honourable Member makes a plea for a priority assessment for both substances and to shift them to the first stage of evaluation. However, this is not possible for different reasons. The review programme of existing active substances is organised in four stages, providing clear legal deadlines for industry, Member States and the Commission and modifying them would lead to situations of legal uncertainties.</p>
<p>One should not forget that the first stage was already established in 1993. Also, from a pure management point of view, the scarce scientific resources had to be used in the most efficient manner and the preparation of the technical dossier by the applicant and the evaluation exercise itself are processes that can take up to ten years. In practical terms, re-scheduling to phase one would not have accelerated the evaluations, both of which are now ongoing.</p>
<p>The evaluation of fipronil is already at EFSA level while for imidacloprid Germany, as Rapporteur Member State, is preparing the draft assessment report. In both cases, important input is expected from the different studies that are being carried out on the subject.</p>
<p>Also, it is fully recognised that the situation is of serious concern, not only from an ecological but also from a social point of view, considering the dramatic consequences on the welfare of the beekeepers and their families.</p>
<p>Therefore the Commission notes with great satisfaction the progress made during this very session of the Parliament on the enlarged specific supporting measures that in the future will become possible through the adoption of the new Council Regulation on actions in the field of beekeeping.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) EQUAL is part of the EU's strategy for more and better jobs and for ensuring that no-one is denied access to them. Funded by the European Social Fund, EQUAL tests new ways of tackling discrimination and inequality experienced by those in work and those looking for a job. With a budget of over € 3 000 million, EQUAL operates in two rounds, the first of which was launched in 2001, with the second being launched in 2004. In the first round, 1,400 Development Partnerships were supported. Given that it is now in the fourth year (out of six years), 67% of the budget has been committed and, to date, 28% has been paid to Member States.</p>
<p>The most visible success in EQUAL is the format of partnership which brings together very disparate groups, many of whom have not previously collaborated, combining skills and resources among a multiplicity of actors within society. This new approach has spawned innovation in a number of areas. Furthermore, Member States are integrating good practice from EQUAL into their National Action Plans for employment, and have identified an extensive array of 'promising practices' which can be found on the web ().</p>
<p>Due to its holistic approach i.e. partnership and empowerment operating within a policy context reinforced by transnational cooperation and supported by national and European platforms for exchange and mainstreaming, EQUAL is considered to have grown beyond the level of previous Community Initiatives and consequently delivered more positive and applicable results. Thus, as set out in the Third report on Economic and Social Cohesion,<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the new generation of employment-related programmes will seek to take on board the lessons of the current EQUAL initiative across the EU (covering innovation, empowerment, partnership and trans-national cooperation in employment matters).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The identification document for equidae is a veterinary document issued primarily for the purpose of tracing individual equidae or, as the case may be in case of animal health prohibitions placed on a holding keeping equidae, to restrict the movement of such animals in accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 90/426/EEC. Since 1 July 2000 all equidae must be accompanied during their movement by an identification document.</p>
<p>In accordance with Directive 90/427/EEC on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in equidae this document is issued for registered equidae either by the breeding organisation approved in accordance with Commission Decision 92/353/EEC, or by an international organisation which manages horses for competition or racing. The identification details entered in the passport established by Decision 93/623/EC must ensure the continued identity of registered equidae.</p>
<p>By adopting Decision 2000/68/EC the Commission laid down the model for the identification document for equidae for breeding and production. This identification document is issued according to the national provisions of the Member State.</p>
<p>Because the identification document for both registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production are set down to address public health, animal health and animal welfare concerns relating to individual animals, the competent authorities of the Member State must ensure that multiple issuing of identification documents is avoided.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0199"></a>

<p>(EN) 1. The Commission has not yet received any specific and detailed information or request for EU cofunding from Greece concerning the damage to rural infrastructure and concerning the destruction of the vegetable production caused by the bad weather conditions that took place recently in Greece. However, a request to grant State Aids has been introduced. Considering the extent of the damage, Community solidarity will be indispensable to overcome as soon as possible the problems rural areas and Greek farmers are confronted with and to rebuild rural infrastructures and production potential lost.</p>
<p>On the basis of the current regulatory framework, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that any Community financial grants that might be necessary to overcome the specific problems of Greek rural areas can be taken from the total appropriations of the 3<span class="sup">rd</span> Community Support Framework for Greece (2000-06). It should be emphasised that European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund - Guidance intervention will be limited to the reconstitution of production potential and not to compensate income losses for the Greek farmers for which such assistance may be given by national funding under the prerequisite of the notification of such State Aids and the Commission approval.</p>
<p>It is up to Greece to submit to the Commission a proposal for the modification of the relevant operational programme and requests to ensure the reconstruction of rural public infrastructures and to support appropriate projects for the reconstitution of production potential of the Greek farmers. There are a number of precedents for similar cases at European Community level.</p>

<p>Following the request by the College on 26 November 2003, a communication on ‘implementing the information and communication strategy’, which addresses this issue, is being prepared.</p>
<p>Following the exceptional solution adopted in 2003<a href="#defann_57_2" name="refann_57_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> with the agreement of the budgetary authority, whereby an operating grant for the Info Points Europe (IPE) and Carrefour rural information networks is still directly supplied in 2004, the only option for funding the Info Points Europe and Carrefour information networks as from 2005 that is compatible with the financial rules in force is via a call for proposals. This could be prepared on a multiannual basis in order to guarantee a minimum of stability. This system would also meet the needs of enlargement and of the very necessary modernisation and extension of the current network.</p>
<p>It remains to be decided whether this call for proposals will be launched on a centralised basis by the European Commission (direct administration) or by each Member State (indirect administration).</p>
<p>The Info Points Europe and Carrefour information networks will, of course, continue to benefit from the technical assistance that the Commission intends to step up within the framework of the enlarged EU, in particular in the form of: free supply of documentation and publications for the general public (around 1 500 000 copies a year – EUR 15), access to the relays and networks intranet, specialist assistance via a relays and networks help desk (at an annual cost of around EUR 1 500 000 – EUR 15), free staff training courses (800 person/days a year – EUR 15), events and networking, in particular regular coordination meetings, visits, exchange programmes for relay staff (over 1 000 person/days a year – EUR 15) and original information products tailored to their specific needs.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed in relation to the use of hair dyes. It has considered all aspects of use of hair dyes in cosmetic products and their impact upon consumer health.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are 89 hair dyes (and not only 8 as mentioned in the question) which have been regulated by the Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC. Use of 17 substances has been banned. With regard to the other 72 substances, the current legislation imposes labelling requirements and fixes very strict maximum concentrations for their use.</p>
<p>In July 2003, the Commission, together with Member States and the representatives of both consumers and industry agreed on the strategy for the systematic evaluation of hair dyes. This strategy is published on the web site of the Commission. The overall objective of the strategy is to regulate the use of substances as hair dye ingredients on the basis of the most recent scientific evaluation of safety dossiers. The industry is required to submit by strict deadlines safety dossiers on hair dyes to be evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers (SCCNFP).</p>
<p>This strategy includes a possibility of setting up a positive list for hair dyes within the Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC.</p>
<p>With a view to strengthening the competitiveness of the cosmetic sector and improving consumer safety, the Commission will carry out in the year 2005 an analysis of the current situation of the sector and the application of the cosmetics legislation.</p>
<p>The fact that a positive list on hair dyes does not exist yet does not mean that the harmful substances can be employed in hair products. Apart from the specific regulation of the above-mentioned 89 hair dyes, the Cosmetics Directive states as a general principle that only cosmetic products that do not cause damage to human health can be put on the market (Article 2 of the Directive). Therefore cosmetic products can only contain safe ingredients.</p>
<p>Moreover, the manufacturers shall keep information on the safety of their cosmetic products readily accessible for the competent control authorities of the Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is in the process of starting the comitology procedure that should lead to the ban of substances for which no safety files have been submitted for evaluation by the SCCNFP.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The use of technology in the electoral process, including electronic voting, is part of electoral procedures, the regulation of which falls under the responsibility of the Member States. This is explicitly confirmed regarding elections to the Parliament in Article 7(2) of the 1976 Act<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which provides that the electoral procedure shall be governed in each Member State by its national provisions. The principle was not changed but confirmed by Council Decision 2002/772/EC amending the 1976 Act<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which entered into force recently.</p>
<p>Naturally, national legislation and practice must respect the general principles of law and fundamental rights. The above-mentioned 1976 Act, as amended by Decision 2002/772/EC, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union provide that Members of the Parliament shall be elected by direct universal suffrage in a free and secret ballot. Compliance with these basic electoral principles, (direct, universal, free and secret suffrage), represents a challenge for systems using electronic voting, but every voting system must respect these principles. The Commission considers that electronic voting can be compatible with these basic electoral principles, provided that procedural, operational and technical standards are such that voting is secure and reliable. The Commission does not have any indications that would imply that the use of electronic voting systems would in any way compromise direct, universal, free and secret character of European parliamentary elections in any Member State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the Honourable Member's concern to ensure that Roma communities in current and future Member States should be able to participate on an equal basis in economic, social and political life. Of course, many of the solutions to the challenges faced by Roma must be found at national, regional and local level. The European Union is committed to supporting efforts by public authorities and civil society to address these challenges.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises that tendering procedures sometimes make it difficult for smaller organisations, including some Roma organisations, to apply for EU funding. However, the Honourable Member will certainly understand that the Commission is under a general obligation to respect the relevant financial regulations and rules governing public procurement.</p>
<p>Over €100 million of EU funding has already been devoted to projects in favour of Roma in acceding and candidate countries through the PHARE programme. These projects have been monitored by the Commission's delegations in the beneficiary countries and are currently the subject of an external evaluation, which should help the Commission and national authorities to learn from past experiences and to maximise the effectiveness of future funding interventions.</p>
<p>New Member States will now have access to the Union's Structural Funds, which may be used inter alia to promote labour market participation and social inclusion of Roma. In negotiations with the national authorities of acceding countries with significant Roma populations, the Commission has placed considerable emphasis on the need to ensure that a significant proportion of EU funding is used to support projects in favour of the Roma. Selective and integrated actions involving improvement of education, health, water, waste water, and road infrastructure will be implemented. Certain measures will be funded at 80% by the EU (the normal limit is 75% for co-financing of public expenditure). The aim will be to begin a process of improvement of living and working conditions, especially an integrated approach to education, advice, and training, to assist in opening up opportunities, particularly for young people. New Member States will also have access to Community programmes in the fields of social inclusion, anti-discrimination, education, training and youth.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that the relevant EU funding instruments and programmes should be implemented in a coherent and coordinated way. Various mechanisms have been put in place to promote coordination and exchanges of information between the relevant Commission services, including specific inter-service meetings on Roma.</p>
<p>It would clearly be positive if similar mechanisms for cooperation and coordination, as well as on-going monitoring during the entire project cycle, could be put in place at national level. One positive example in this respect is the establishment in Slovakia, at the suggestion of the Commission, of a committee bringing together government officials, municipalities and Roma representatives to monitor the implementation of Structural Fund programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0211"></a>
