<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Enrique Barón Crespo (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Author</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 July, the Director-General of the WTO, Mr Pascal Lamy, announced, as a result of the meeting of the trade negotiations committee of the WTO in Geneva, the <span class="italic">sine die</span> suspension of the Doha Round negotiations. I hope that this suspension is provisional and that the talks are not reduced to ashes, but rather that a phoenix can rise from them – as the Commissioner has said.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision, which, provisionally, has put an end to five years of negotiations and more than seven years of diplomatic efforts, has led to great uncertainty within the multilateral framework of the WTO trade negotiations and, furthermore, it raises a problem with regard to an informal time limit, which is more political than chronological: the forthcoming expiry of the mandate of the Trade Promotion Authority, granted to the President by the United States Congress to allow him to negotiate in global terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would say in passing that it is odd that for an organisation such as the WTO, which is an intergovernmental organisation and a ministerial conference, everything depends on a decision by a Parliament, the United States Congress, highly respectable though it is. The other Parliaments of the world, beginning with the European Parliament, also have the right to express an opinion, without imposing any kind of condition, or any guillotines, such as those currently being imposed by the United States Congress. In this regard, I would like to say that next week, in the governing committee of the parliamentary assembly that we have created between the European Parliament and the Interparliamentary Union, we will have the opportunity to discuss and work on this issue with representatives of the majority of the world’s Parliaments, because we believe that this is an issue that concerns all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament, and specifically in the Committee on International Trade, have not waited until the holidays were over to express our concern. I did so, on behalf of that Committee, immediately after the announcement, pointing out that we cannot resign ourselves to a definitive failure of the negotiations. What we have to see is how we can move on from this crossroads and how we can put the process back on track. There have been a series of contacts and bilateral meetings during August and I hope that the Commissioner can tell us about any opportunities for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the Commission must try to exploit its mandate as far as it possibly can, because we have responsibilities. Firstly, to defend our interests, but at the same time also to promote the principle that a multilateral system which benefits everybody, not just the developed countries, but also those countries that should be the main objective of the negotiation – the developing countries and, above all, the least-developed countries – can truly play a fundamental role, such as the one the European Union should play as the world’s leading commercial power.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is important for the European Parliament to speak out and to support the possibility that we can continue with, put back on track and renew the objective of achieving a Doha Round for development and also to support the Commission – which has not had much of a holiday in this regard – which we hope can continue working to conclude this Round.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a margin for manoeuvre; there always is a margin in politics, though, chronologically speaking, the time limits are running out, and perhaps the need to act quickly can help. Mr President, we believe that the comments the Commissioner can make today are important and, above all, we want him to know that he can count on our concern, our support and our desire for this Round to once again become a process geared towards a more prosperous and cooperative humanity in the future.</p>

I welcome the fact that he and other Members of this House are meeting other parliamentarians from WTO member countries to review this matter. The more we can gain a broad understanding of what is at stake and what the problems are, and the more we can spread that knowledge amongst the players in the various WTO countries – rather than keeping this knowledge to a very tightly-knit circle of negotiators – then the better off we will be. I will certainly pursue that objective when I visit Washington DC later this month to meet with leading figures on the Hill.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time I discussed the Doha Development Agenda with some of the Members of this House was in Geneva in late June. First of all I would like to say how much I appreciated your presence there, your networking activities and the way in which you played an interesting and useful role among the negotiating parties. We will need your backing in the future in our efforts to convince our WTO partners to resume these negotiations, and I very strongly commend the approach taken by the Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the week I will travel to Rio de Janeiro at the invitation of the Government of Brazil and the G20 Group of developing countries. This will be the first chance to review at ministerial level what happened in Geneva in July, to discuss our respective positions and to assess the possibility of how and when we can move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In the weeks following the suspension, all sides have expressed a commitment to seeing the Round succeed. Nobody is saying, on the face of it at any rate, that they are no longer committed to it, and Doha certainly needs that level of commitment. In all our actions and statements we need to top up confidence in the Round and the process and to reassert the values of multilateralism and the economic benefits of a wide and ambitious deal. However, the rhetoric has to be matched with political leadership. What we are faced with is a lack of what one might call ‘realistic ambition’.</p>
<p class="contents">All sides are exporting their domestic constraints into these negotiations. Perhaps that is inevitable, but it is not or should not be allowed to become an excuse for failure. Yet even in the most difficult and seemingly intractable areas of negotiation, the positions on agriculture are not that divergent. They are not so far apart that they are irreconcilable. They dictate that the EU lift its average tariff cut close to that requested by the G-20 developing countries. The EU signalled in Geneva that it was willing to negotiate on that as part of a balanced package – if others too are prepared to move forwards and show the same sort of flexibility we ourselves are demonstrating.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to move in the direction I have indicated we could, then in the right circumstances, this would represent a substantial shift from our original offer of a 39% average farm tariff cut, which is already much higher than the cuts accepted in the Uruguay Round. These would be the steepest farm tariff cuts ever accepted as part of a multilateral trade negotiation. Nobody could describe this as ‘Doha-light’. To these can be added the subsidy cuts flowing from EU reform, which would see EU producers withdraw dramatically from key global export markets such as milk and poultry, and the contraction of the EU grain market as demand for animal feed falls. If one puts all that together it amounts to a major new market access package for competitive agricultural exporters such as the United States, Australia and other members of the Cairns Group. It would potentially downsize European agriculture by up to USD 20 billion per year.</p>
<p class="contents">To dismiss this as insignificant, as some have done, is either a crude negotiating posture or a failure to do the necessary maths. In return for those cuts, the EU is looking to the United States to match it in cutting trade-distorting farm subsidies, which the developing world now rightly regards as the condition and catalyst for any final Doha agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States has offered significant cuts in the so-called ‘amber box’ trade-distorting subsidies, from USD 19.1 billion down to USD 7.6 billion. This sounds good, and is to be welcomed. However, the United States has also proposed an increase in what it is allowed to spend in other categories of trade-distorting subsidy, while rejecting the idea of directly reforming those subsidy programmes so as to ensure that they no longer distort trade. If one adds together the three types of proposed trade-distorting support that the United States wants to keep, one actually arrives at a potential new ceiling of USD 22.7 billion, which is more than the United States currently spends.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, by the end of the Doha implementation period, US trade-distorting payments to farmers could actually go up as a result of what the US tabled in its offer last October. It is understandable that the US’s trading partners have found that unacceptable, especially given the sweeping cuts that the US is demanding from others, in terms both of subsidies and tariffs. Quite rightly, developing countries are insisting on an effective reduction in US subsidies, and the EU supports that. Unless there is a shift in the US position, advanced developing countries such as Brazil and India will not be prepared to offer greater access to their markets for industrial goods and services, and that is the crux of the eventual deal we are seeking.</p>
<p class="contents">That deal will be hard to reach. I do not underestimate the difficulties that will arise in the negotiations we are yet to have with the advanced developing countries on industrial tariffs. However, it is the stand-off on agriculture, which represents only a fraction of trade for developing and developed countries alike, that is preventing the Doha negotiations from addressing trade in manufacturing and services, which is where the vast bulk of the potential economic gains from this round lie.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only achieve closure on Doha if all the parties involved make the effort to sell an outcome on its merits across <span class="italic">all</span> areas of the negotiations. These include not only agriculture and farm tariffs, but also manufacturing, services and rules. All sides should realise that a realistically ambitious and achievable outcome, far from being a ‘Doha-light’, would actually yield deep-seated structural changes in farm policies and create new trade flows in goods and services on a scale unmatched in any previous trade rounds. In other words, there is an awful lot already on the table, as Mr Lamy has repeatedly pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">What is being lost in a continued stalemate – let us be clear about this – is being lost first and foremost by developing countries. It is they who are losing new trade opportunities. Even more importantly, they risk losing out as a result of a weakening of the multilateral trading system. We on the EU side will try to do as much as we possibly can, in any scenario, for the weaker and more vulnerable developing countries, without seeking to divide the WTO membership. In particular, we will keep our promises on Aid for Trade, and we will maintain our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Some will ask how it is that suspension of the DDA will affect our broader trade policy stance. The answer is that our commitment to Doha will remain paramount. Nothing can replace the WTO. Firstly, it is based on equality and the rule of law, rather than on raw power. Secondly, some benefits can only be achieved in a multilateral context, such as new disciplines on farm or fishery subsidies, a new agreement on trade facilitation, new disciplines for anti-dumping tools and better and clearer rules on regional trade agreements. These are examples of areas where any number of bilateral agreements could not even begin to achieve the sort of improvement and strengthening of trade rules and the trade system that we are seeking. Thirdly, these are the only form of negotiations in which smaller developing countries can punch their collective political weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the dispute settlement system itself is one of the cornerstones of the WTO system and a feature unique in international law. There is no doubt that any erosion of confidence in the multilateral trading system as a whole would in the long term also critically affect that dispute settlement system.</p>
<p class="contents">Bilateral and regional deals are therefore not an alternative to multilateral negotiations, but rather an add-on and a complement that helps to address in greater depth a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers, as well as establishing disciplines in areas in which WTO members have decided – at least for the time being – not to negotiate collectively within the multilateral system, be it in relation to competition rules, government procurement or the labour dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking at several negotiations in this context. Some are already in progress, while others will be launched when the conditions are ripe. Mercosur, the GCC and Central America are in the first group and we are also looking at Ukraine, India, Korea and the ASEAN countries as potential partners for new initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that I and the Commission remain firmly committed to a successful outcome of the multilateral round and that I want to work closely with you in this House to achieve that goal. That remains my priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also shortly present soon two communications – one in October on external aspects of our competitiveness in Europe, and one on trade relations with China. These will tackle other key issues of our future trade policy. I am keen to discuss both of these with you in the coming weeks, and look forward to doing so. As a team I believe we should continue to work together in the future as well as we have done in the past – for Europe’s sake, but also for the benefit of the global economy and in particular for the most needy developing countries.</p>

<p class="contents">These costs arise, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, from lost earnings to the global economy, development and employment, earnings which the successful completion of negotiations would have generated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, from the undermining of progress in certain sectors of activity which are especially important to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, from the weakened credibility of the World Trade Organisation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the danger in the event of a total failure far outweighs the danger of achieving an albeit less ambitious overall agreement, although an agreement cannot be accepted at any cost to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union maintained a constructive and responsible position. It tabled noteworthy proposals and abandoned many of its objectives right from the start of the round. Consequently, any return to the negotiating table depends on flexibility on the part of other leading trade partners if we are to envisage a balanced result.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, continue to advocate multilateralism. The commitment to a multilateral trade system makes a decisive contribution towards security, transparency and the stability of international trade. It also helps to disseminate enhanced economic interdependence across international political cooperation. The breakdown of multilateralism contains within it the danger of sectoral trade conflicts and the revival of regional trade strongholds.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the successful completion of multilateral trade negotiations should remain – as the Commission and the chairman of our committee emphasised – the supreme choice, the supreme priority on the Union's agenda. At the same time, we must strengthen supplementary strategies of bilateral and cross-regional relations with other important partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability of the global trade system calls, in my opinion, for new dynamic impetus to the link between commercial interdependence and joint responsibility between the European Union and the United States of America and this link between interdependence and joint responsibility must be verified.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mr Barón Crespo before me and his country's victory over Greece in the World Basketball Championship in mind, I would suggest that we look on the outcome of these negotiations so far as time out rather than a definitive breakdown.</p>

It represents a triumph of the narrow interests of some countries over the broader interest of the international community and, like the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, we are all, of course, thinking about the mid-term elections due to take place in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The suspension already potentially threatens the multilateral system as the main framework of trade negotiations and a return to more imbalanced bilateral negotiations that will act to the detriment of the poorest, and in particular the smallest, countries, as you pointed out, Mr Mandelson. Furthermore, it will leave the multilateral system in place, which will not disappear, though the idea was to begin to reform it and make it more compatible with the objectives of development and with the other rules of the international community: namely the need to take on board the objectives of public health, the environment, and tomorrow – we hope – the social dimension of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The main losers of this suspension of the round of negotiations will be developing countries, and, of those, the least advanced countries in particular. Irrespective of the shortcomings and the limitations, what was on the table, and what was being proposed by the EU – which was often, indeed, what Parliament wanted to see – will be jeopardised, will be lost: the abolition of export subsidies by 2013, free access, as regards rights and quotas, for products from the least developed countries to the markets of the developed countries, even though the problem remained of the 3% tariff lines that a number of other industrialised countries had sought, increased access to the markets of industrialised countries for all agricultural production in developing countries, even though the US proposals fall well short of what is required, addressing the situation of cotton producers, the trade-related assistance package, and the amendment to the Trade Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on access to medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that you are simply announcing that you are once again going to set forth in search of peace, to meet again with the G20 and the United States and to attempt to find ways to return to the negotiating table. We must not, in my view, allow the Doha Round to die. Whatever the difficulties posed by the expiry of the authorisation to negotiate granted by Congress to the US administration, we must not allow the undertakings and the promises that had been made simply to be thrown out of the window, and I am delighted to hear that, for its part, the EU will honour its commitments and keep its promises.</p>
<p class="contents">We should perhaps return simply to the heart of the Round and remind our partners from the industrialised countries that we knew that it would not be based on reciprocity, and that we would have to offer more in the way of access for agricultural products than we would gain via industrial tariffs and the opening up of markets and services. Europe must continue to promote the multilateral system. It certainly needs to be reformed so that there can remain a framework of confidence between developing and developed countries. After all, it is within the multilateral system that the developing countries can continue to be heard via the G20 and the G90, and that the trade rules can be made more compatible with the aims of eradicating poverty and with all of the other rules of the multilateral system.</p>

That is what more and more commentators seem to assume that it has. Especially since Hong Kong, nine months ago, no progress has been made, and in July, negotiations were postponed indefinitely. Like the Commissioner, and most fellow Members of this House for that matter, I refuse to believe, though, that this is the beginning of the end. There is, after all, a great deal at stake. Outright failure could well result in the collapse of the multilateral trade system, with all that this entails.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure to reach a global trade agreement increases the risk of ever more countries resorting to bilateral or regional agreements, which, in any case, puts poor countries in a weaker position. In addition, an interruption in negotiations can increase the number of trade disputes, during which WTO Members will try legal action as a way of getting what they did not manage to get via an agreement. There is more, though, as the Commission pointed out: sooner or later, the WTO’s very <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> will be challenged. It is therefore necessary, now more than ever, to make the WTO more transparent and enhance its democratic legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group sees it as essential that rich and more developed countries should try to bring their viewpoints closer together beforehand. There is absolutely no point in organising another high mass if the US and the EU fail to close the gap between them in the area of their agricultural supply and other issues. The American Congress recently applauded the tough stance adopted by the US negotiators. A blame game of this kind will do nothing to bring about constructive solutions. All key players, including the EU, the US and the G20, have to pull their weight in order to achieve a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, what is termed the Hong Kong <span class="italic">acquis</span> must remain intact in full. All pro-development commitments must be delivered upon. Whether or not an agreement is reached, the EU must not back out of its intention to abolish export subsidies by 2015. At the same time, all developed countries and advanced developing countries must be invited to observe the EU’s ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The tone of this compromise resolution is voluntaristic and positive. It confirms our belief in a multilateral approach of trade policy despite everything, based on the honest conviction that when the Doha Development Agenda fails, there are unfortunately no winners, only losers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You say that you hope that it will be completed nonetheless, but on what do you base that hope? You say that the developing countries are losing out and that the <span class="italic">impasse</span> damages them more than anyone else, but why is it that the developing world countries and their representatives have not completed the round? Perhaps they took another view of it and were even smart enough not to, on the grounds that the liberalisation that underlies your thinking, the liberalisation that you want to push through, has self-evidently not made them rich. Far, too, from filling the stomachs of the people who live there, it has driven them into debt and has failed to solve the problem of famine. This is the first time that these countries have come together, and if they manage to wield enough clout against the industrial nations of the West to cause this thing to fail, then that puts things in a different light and we need to see if we can come up with another offer.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that the reduction in customs duties as offered will bring EUR 20 billion to European agriculture, but are these EUR 20 billion not surplus to it, and – if we make this cut – would these EUR 20 billion not at least benefit the countries of the developing world, or would this be nothing more than a reduction in food standards? Are the countries there being bought off for less than they need to rise above poverty, with agriculture here being ruined as a consequence?</p>
<p class="contents">Qualified access is what is needed. The market access that you offer in return for access to the developing world’s markets for industrial products and services, destroys their infrastructures and the fragile development of their own industries and trades, while denying agriculture here a chance of existence, even though we need, as a matter of urgency, to produce food. It follows that quality and qualified market access are what is needed to enable the countries of the developing world to enjoy our price levels and standards and to develop their own economies.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement on sugar showed us that those ACP countries that were able to supply sugar while complying with these conditions saw their economies develop, while those that were unable to do so found themselves having to sell to the multinationals at prices below the poverty level, and that state of affairs is going to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner Mandelson, what you should do is make a proper offer of the sort that these countries can agree to, one that stabilises food supply and improves the stability and quality of trade, rather than one with a general tendency to put farmers around the world out of business. It is then, I believe, that the multilateral approach will be the right one, and everyone will be able to benefit from it in a way that they certainly cannot from the liberalisation that you are proposing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What was it meant to develop? That is the core issue. Was it only trade – trade for trade’s sake – that was meant to develop, or was it the intention that more trade should bring development in its wake? For if the latter is what is intended, then there is a great deal more that must be included in the negotiations; it will be necessary to ask what contribution trade makes in the various countries in terms of raised social standards, of improved protection for the environment, of enhanced quality of life. That is a quite different approach from a desire, above all else, to open up markets in order to exchange bigger trade margins, for there can be no reciprocity then.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity is about the stronger helping the weaker, and what that means is that the more developed countries must give more than those that have not developed to the same degree. It is not only quantity that is at issue here; it also means a qualitatively different approach, not to mention the insight that those who have not yet developed the market in their own countries must be enabled to do this before anything else happens. It may be that they will need to keep their markets closed for a time before they can be opened up.</p>
<p class="contents">What use is it to many developing countries to be allowed to export to the European Union if they have no products they can export, quite simply because they cannot even yet feed their own people? Yet, at the same time, these countries are told that if they are to be allowed to do that, they must be so good as to open up their markets to our services and our industries. No agreement will ever be reached if our way of negotiating never rises above this, and I say that as one who is fanatical in support for a multilateral system.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Mandelson, you will recall that I have, on very many occasions, asked you whether you really believe that the USA is interested in a multilateral conclusion to the WTO round. I have always said that I do not. The Americans can defend their interests better if they are not tied down by multilateral agreements. That is why it is much more important that the European Union should join together with the G20, and that is something to which we must, of course, give renewed consideration in view of the immense differences between the countries of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">This cannot be only about opening up markets if the consequence of doing so is to put the European market at the mercy of Brazilian agri-business, which is huge and dominated by three families; in no way whatever does that do anything to help these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we need to do is to rethink our approach. We want trade. Again and again, you say that we want free trade. We can have an ideological disagreement about that; I do not want that sort of liberalisation, but let us leave that to one side for a moment. What matters is not so much that we should have free trade, but that trade should be made fair. Fair trade is just trade, and ‘just’ does not mean ‘equal’. If the same standards are applied to all categories of countries as regards reduction of tariffs and the opening-up of their markets, then that may be no more than equal treatment, but it is not just.</p>
<p class="contents">You must change the mandate that you have been given; this is the approach that you need. If you want to advance trade, you have to bear in mind – and, indeed, make it your priority to do so – the circumstances of the individual countries and the stage of development that they have reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For some time now, I have been calling for the exclusion of agriculture from these talks. Agriculture makes up a mere 5% of world trade, yet the blame for the collapse of the talks is laid firmly at European farm gates. Why should 5% hold back the other 95% of trade? It is time to remember that.</p>
<p class="contents">I attended the Doha Round of talks in Hong Kong last December and before that those in Cancún, and I informed this Parliament of the false impression that is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to EU markets. Nothing could be further from the truth, and we are hearing it again in this Chamber today. The developing countries have little to gain from such a gesture; in fact, the EU already allows free access to 50 least-developed countries as it is. The real winners would be the beef barons of South America, if we were to allow Irish farmers to be sold out. The real losers in this situation would be the small European farmers who are already on the breadline. Let us make no mistake about that.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent survey of Irish consumers, for example, revealed that just one in five people has confidence in food imported from outside the European Union. This is not surprising. Opening up the EU agricultural market any further will bring food security and food traceability into serious question. Are we willing to accept the scenario of uncertainty regarding the food we feed our children, in the light of food safety scares such as mad cow disease, CJD, or avian influenza? Are we willing to accept a free-for-all approach to the use of angel dust and other suspicious substances amongst Brazilian beef farmers?</p>
<p class="contents">We in Ireland have recently witnessed the demise of the Irish sugar industry. Brazilian sugar barons are the beneficiaries of the recent sugar reform, while 4 000 Irish sugar beet farmers have been made redundant. In Hong Kong last December I witnessed Korean farmers fighting for a livelihood which is currently being threatened by transnational grain corporations, who are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries. This is a fallacy. It is clear that the WTO cannot succeed as long as we insist on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihoods of small European and Irish farmers. It is time to move on. It is time to exclude agriculture from the talks once and for all and not sell out European farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The WTO has lost some of its credibility, whilst global trade has benefited from drafting and enforcing international rules for the movement of trade. As I fear that the developing countries will be footing the bill for this suspension, I would call on Commissioner Mandelson to monitor the interests of those countries both multilaterally and bilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a desperate lack of economic prospects in Africa is one of the factors forcing an increasing number of people to seek their salvation in Europe. I personally have my doubts as to the composition of the G20. After all, new economic power will also need to translate into new responsibility. Also, I have always backed American trade representative Susan Schwab’s appeal to China to show evidence of this new responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in your interview with the German magazine <span class="italic">Internationale Politik</span>, you expressed your commitment to carry on in order to get Doha back on track. Could you explain to me on what your optimism is founded, particularly in the light of your indication that you do not expect the negotiations to be complete before the end of the year? Do you have any evidence to assume that the Americans will make a move by then? Moreover, I should like to urge you once again to reflect very carefully on the European agenda after Doha, for that may be more desirable than we may think. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The objective of the WTO negotiations, as we know, was to improve the position of the developing countries, and all those involved had to do their bit: Europe in the area of import tariffs for agricultural products, the United States in the shape of internal support to farmers, developing countries, such as Brazil and India, with regard to access to their markets for industrial products, and suchlike. It is very unfortunate that no progress has been made and further negotiations could now be a long time coming.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to point the finger at any of the parties, for that is also difficult with so many parties being sat around the table, but it should be said that the way in which the Commissioner has acted has unfortunately not led to the desired results, and that it is now becoming more difficult for developing countries to gain a stronger foothold in the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased, though, that the Commissioner has expressed his commitment to the developing countries more than once, and I will hold him to that if I may. We cannot change the facts, and that is why it is important to look to the future, particularly that of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">During the negotiation round, agreement was reached, in principle, about a number of items that are very important for developing countries, which include, as they have already been mentioned: aid for trade, no import duties for the poorest countries, trade facilities, as well as special and differentiated treatment. What could have been a major step forward, is now left in the lap of the Gods. I understand, and also condone the fact, that the Commissioner would like those agreements to go ahead as much as possible, but I then wonder how, according to the Commissioner, can this be done in those areas? Can the plans be implemented as yet and if so, how?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the Export Promotion Organisations (EPOs) that are related to the WTO. We have not yet seen any concrete proposals, and that is why I should like to know: what is, according to the Commission, the impact of the suspension of the WTO negotiations on the developments of EPOs? Does the Commissioner believe that, in the framework of the EPO negotiations, there is scope for walking the extra mile for the benefit of the ACP countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House has been there through every twist and turn of the negotiations; it has seen how difficult it is to conduct them on a multilateral basis, and how difficult it is, too, to understand what is meant by a modern trade policy and trade strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking personally, I am highly sceptical as to whether we have a right understanding of it even now. I can go along with much of what you have said just now, and I am grateful to you for referring to the Commission’s new communication, <span class="italic">‘Global Europe: Competing in the World’, </span>which will be reaching us shortly. Sometimes, though, I take a rather sceptical view of our own self-criticism and our understanding of the changes that have come about in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, it is certainly easy to criticise the Americans – and there is no shortage of reasons for doing it – but it is also important that it be mentioned that there is, in developing countries too – Brazil being one of them – and for reasons that Members have already addressed, scepticism about agreeing with the WTO. Another factor may well be that China has become a global trading partner, with a greater impact on countries like Mexico, to name but one, than it has in the EU or the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are so many reasons, and I sometimes find it regrettable that the debate on a modern trade policy, to which you yourself refer in your own document, is not engaged in at the necessary depth. What is also lacking is an understanding of the fact that the EU’s Member States have taken up very different positions as regards the challenges of globalisation. Some of our countries are very open, because they can afford to be, while some, however, are in difficulties because they got around only very late to introducing reforms and transforming themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This is evident from the textiles debate and from the anti-dumping debate with reference to shoes, and there are many other examples. I quite simply do not see us actually thinking through what we mean by modern trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That involves – as I have mentioned – the part played by China. Have we really understood what China’s accession to the WTO means? If you are going to consider the possibility of Russia joining it there, Commissioner, then we urge you to discuss the matter with us; the lack of any debate about the effects and consequences of that is something I find regrettable, and, for that reason, I am in favour of having one. It is something for which this House expressed its support as long ago as 2002, at the same time as it declared itself in favour of negotiations with Asia, and yet, as I see it, the debate with this House and with the responsible committee is lacking in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see a debate about what our participation in the GATS+ negotiations forming part of the bilateral round might mean; here, too, you are right, but I do wish we could have a debate about it.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do think needs to be done if we are to talk in terms of a modern trade policy is for this House to be fully consulted, not just when we are called upon to agree to the outcomes of negotiations, but at the outset, when such negotiations are being considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, the Council, and this House, meeting in Stuttgart, have already negotiated a statement, and that involved this House being consulted either fully or to a considerable degree. I would recommend to you that we do the same thing again, and hope that you can agree to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It threatens parity and prosperity for the developing world, jobs, growth and security in Europe, and the future of the multilateral trade system itself. A new explosion of discriminatory bilateral and regional agreements could substitute global liberalisation, eroding the multilateral and rules-based system of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">While some might say that no deal was better than a bad deal for developing countries, without the shield of the WTO – as you said, Commissioner – they will be left vulnerable to use and abuse in a unilateral scramble for trade domination. Failure will mean that protectionism will fill the vacuum as momentum towards wide-ranging reduction of barriers ceases; the world economy will slow down and global trade imbalances will continue to rise; financial markets will become more unstable; and international economic cooperation will break down further. With the erosion of the WTO system, speculation is rife about what form a ‘Plan B’ might take: perhaps and East Asia free trade area; perhaps Japan’s proposal for a pan-Asian comprehensive economic partnership that includes India, Australia and New Zealand. Either of those would create a new Asian bloc that, along with the European Union and NAFTA, would produce a tri-polar world with all its inherent instabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that there is now an urgent need for a Plan B to get world trade policy back on track and for the EU to play a key role in shaping the world trade order? Does the Commission agree that such a strategy must have these three key objectives: to spur the revival of Doha; to offer an ambitious alternative to restart the process of liberalisation on the widest possible basis if our primary goal fails; and to counter the proliferation of preferential deals amongst small groups of countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Time and time again I have stood in front of you, Commissioner, and reflected on the finger-pointing blame game that has plagued progress. It is time to set that blame aside. The ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative shows that the EU can do good, but we can and must do better before the US mandate expires and, with it, our opportunity to eradicate poverty and distribute fairly the benefits of globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear that the slogan ‘Free trade = poverty reduction’ was just bait to persuade the southern, poorest countries of the world to endorse the expectations of the industrialised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The real reason for the suspension of the WTO talks was that it was impossible to reach an agreement among the six main nations, which were determined to defend the interests of their agribusinesses; the other 143 countries were excluded from the negotiations. According to the FAO, the breakdown was due to having focused all the talks on free trade instead of fair trade. It is better to have no agreement at all than a bad agreement!</p>
<p class="contents">The suspension of the talks may provide an opportunity for reviewing the Commission’s negotiating mandate, which should concentrate on: 1) reforming the WTO to make it more transparent, more inclusive and more democratic, embedded within the UN system, and bound in its decision-making by the framework of international law; 2) reviewing the three main agreements now on the agenda: agriculture, intellectual property and services; 3) providing a binding frame of reference for the activities of transnational companies; 4) making respect for the rights of peoples a condition of free trade, by ensuring that the human rights clause, as approved by Parliament on 14 February, is observed; 5) refusing at bilateral or regional level to sidestep the rules agreed upon at multilateral level, taking the EPA talks with the ACP countries as an example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament cannot look the other way when negotiations which are so important at multilateral level and which had offered such great hopes for more organised, transparent, free and fair trade are suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">We would refer to the motion for a resolution presented by our group with regard to the concrete aspects we are debating here. We would like to point out, however, that a failure of the Doha Round would be a failure for international trade and for the multilateral system, since it would jeopardise the achievements such as tariff and trade preferences and would lead to a multiplicity and overlapping of rules, thereby making companies’ lives more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The real fundamental reasons for this failure must be entirely exposed. The inflexible States that have hindered the negotiation must be condemned, and we must not give up on the negotiations. They must be revived so that we can take advantage of the progress already made and make the Doha Round a success for the sake of a fairer form of globalisation and for the sake of the WTO itself. The very future of this organisation is at stake; the WTO could be greatly harmed by this crisis. This requires serious reflection, and the WTO’s operating mechanisms must be updated, modernised and democratised.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must continue to play the role that has been assigned to us by seriously and rigorously monitoring the situation that has been created and promoting a solution to the current impasse for the good of everybody, but above all, as others have said, for the good of the least-developed countries.</p>

As we have seen over the past few years, no particular success has been achieved by going from one round to another and constantly saying that we are not satisfied but will keep going, so it follows that the time now left to us must be, not least, a time in which we reflect on things.</p>
<p class="contents">Theoretically, we all realise that the WTO, with its 150 member states, cannot be managed in the same way as it was at the beginning, when it had 23 of them. Why do we not draw particular conclusions from this? Why, too, can we not for once consider where, overall, Europe’s interests lie, and what our trade position is in the various sectors? It is not enough to say that agriculture accounts for only 2% or 3% of the total trade figures if those figures, in effect, relate to large regions of the European Union and would change the shape of our society, and so we need to come up with a sort of overall concept. It really is worth trying to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither WTO negotiations nor trade talks carried on a patchwork basis, along the lines of 'I give you three cows and you give me two fishes in exchange', are no use any more. If the differences between states are constantly on the increase – and you, Commissioner, said as much – then why are we thinking in such categories as ‘multilateral’ or ‘bilateral’? Why can we not start thinking in terms of – among others – ‘multiregional’ categories?</p>
<p class="contents">In a nuanced world like this one, we cannot apply the same yardstick to every state. However much we may cherish development policy – and I, too, am in favour of it – we, in this European Union, also have an obligation to our own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very important in these rounds – as their failure demonstrated – is the need for greater involvement of the parliaments in the negotiations. It is not enough for a parliament to be able, at the end, to give or withhold its approval. Since we lament the failure to involve the public, let at least their representatives have the right to be present at negotiations and consulted – if no more than that – while they are in progress, for it is we, at the end of the day, who have to explain them to the electorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was agreed that all export subsidies for agricultural products would be abolished in 2013 and that the US and Japan would follow in the EU’s footsteps by guaranteeing free market access to the least developed countries for 97% of all products; there was agreement about an extensive package of aid for trade; and, finally, the Americans had said that they intended to start phasing out their support to the cotton sector.</p>
<p class="contents">That, after five years, was a hard-won result, but the signature is, of course, missing, and, as I already stated I do not believe that the poorest countries should lose out as a result of that. It is simply crucial that these measures be taken if we want to achieve the Millennium Objectives by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to my written request, the Commissioner has expressed his willingness to propose a frontloading arrangement with this package. Would it be possible for him to confirm his commitment to this here in this debate? Could he also confirm that the EU is prepared to abolish its export subsidies in 2013, unilaterally if need be?</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, does he not share my view that a frontloading measure of this kind could also help get things back on track for the least developed countries? I still take the view that, if deals are done bilaterally, multilaterally, regionally or however else one would like to call it, among the strongest parties in other words, it is particularly the weakest countries that stand to lose out. This is something the Commissioner has said himself on many occasions, and that is why he has every reason to state that, since those countries should not be at the receiving end of those deals, we should as yet commit to this multilateral trade agreement.</p>

If the situation were not so tragic, everyone would be relieved that the wolves are leaving the woods with their identities revealed and that the apprentices are once again seeing that the masters can sometimes get a taste of their own medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, Mr Mandelson, to boycott the meeting in Canberra, in Australia, scheduled for two weeks hence, because the World Trade Organisation should not be buried so hastily. The situation is extremely serious, because governments have shown themselves to be incapable of managing world trade for the common good, and worse, incapable of setting a development timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to share some thoughts and a proposal with you. As regards the Doha Agenda, it is worth taking note of the development areas on which there is consensus, and postponing the reform of international trade until the developing countries have adopted social and environmental standards conducive to fair competition in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment relates to farming. The EU should not offer any more concessions until it discovers what form farming will take after 2013, bearing in mind the major developments offered by biotechnologies and the problems of feeding people that will inevitably arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, Commissioner, can you assure us that the common agricultural policy currently in force following the 2003 reform is compatible with current WTO rules, and that we do not run the risk of losing out in a dispute brought before the Dispute Settlement Body?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, given the inability of our political leadership to find common ground on international trade, I should like to suggest that a Parliament initiative take place without delay under the auspices of the world interparliamentary union and the European Parliament. This initiative would consist of questioning the citizens’ legitimate representatives on this issue and of making suggestions to those representatives on the right way forward for sorting out the appalling mess in which international trade finds itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Realistically, Commissioner, until we in the rich world tackle the need for fairer and better access to our markets, there will be no prospect of a wider deal on industrial goods and services. A shift to regional trade deals would, as you and others have said, be a major step backwards and undermine the essential principle of non-discrimination. Such deals would exclude most of the world’s poorest countries, including ACP countries, which are of course by definition generally small, vulnerable and of little economic significance.</p>
<p class="contents">Before returning to the negotiations, Commissioner, the rich countries must deal with subsidies and dumping, especially as regards cotton. Also, there is an urgent need for a decision on Aid for Trade, with new money and with no strings attached. In addition, it needs to be understood, during the preparations, that the pace and scale of market opening is critical for developing countries, as is special and differential treatment and tariff protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone has mentioned the danger of a flood of trade complaints to the WTO, and it is my belief that there should be major reform of the sanction mechanism, which currently only comes into play when the complainant is a major player. ACP commodity-dependent countries know this full well and to their cost.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Waving or drowning’: it is sometimes very difficult to tell the difference. Multilateral agreement is essential. Regional, bilateral agreements are not what we are looking for.</p>
<p class="contents">You now face a formidable task, Commissioner, and one that will severely test your diplomatic and consensus-building skills, as well as those of others. We wish you well in that task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of us believed that they were doomed from the start, specifically because the EU gave too much too soon, while the US gave very little at the beginning and remained dogged in its position.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been too much focus on agriculture, which you have said yourself, Commissioner. Too much blame is now being levelled at agriculture for this apparent failure of the talks. Doha was oversold for its potential for lifting the poor out of poverty. I have said here before that the poor are used far too often in far too many negotiations. Their interests were not being best served in the talks that have gone on to date.</p>
<p class="contents">The price for EU agriculture and for EU consumers in terms of food supply is enormous – you have outlined it to us here this morning: downsizing by USD 20 billion a year. I wonder whether we could put names and faces on that downsizing. We are retracting from milk, poultry and grain markets, not to mention beef. I do not know many poor farmers who will gain from that, but I know many in the G20 who are not poor and who would gain significantly. In my view, no deal <span class="italic">is</span> better than a bad deal.</p>
<p class="contents">If the world’s poor need food to eat and clean water to drink – and we know they do – then Doha was never going to deliver that to them. I am sorry to say that, but that is the case. We need to add to that the real threat here for the European Union. We have raised standards of food production; we have environmental and animal welfare issues. These were never on the table at Doha, so we were never going to have fair trade for farmers globally.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some questions to ask the Commissioner, one of which is very specific. I shall answer the first myself: will world trade – free trade – deliver sufficient global food supply? I think not. We need to look after food production just as we are concerned about energy now. Lastly, what about CAP reforms? We have them on the table; we are going to have to give more. Is that what we have ended up with at the table now, in giving too much too soon? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The alternative to a successful Doha Round is sadly already emerging. It is a backward step to a world of unequal and exclusive bilateral deals: deals that are already strong-arming many poor countries into accepting lesser terms on market access and intellectual property rights; deals that are leaving the poorest countries out in the cold. I believe that we still can and should go the extra mile to ensure the completion of a round that is truly about development. That will take time. In the short term, as others have said, we need to rescue the gains made at Hong Kong: the landmark agreement to end export subsidies by 2013; duty- and quota-free access for the poorest countries, modelled on the EU’s pioneering ‘Everything But Arms’ scheme; as well as a substantial commitment to expanding aid for trade to improve supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructures in the LDCs.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the Commissioner on the flexibility he has shown since the collapse of the single undertaking in seeking to salvage the development package – a flexibility again, I am afraid, lacking in some of our negotiating partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Amid the stock-taking at the WTO, the recent report of that organisation’s task force on Aid for Trade is timely. It highlights the real need for demand-driven additional aid, aid targeted to enable the poorest countries to participate in the global trading system. Aid for Trade cannot substitute for delivery of the Doha Round, yet, in the intervening period, it remains an important tool to meet the technical and logistical challenges that these countries face in bringing their goods to the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">The faltering of the Doha talks and the disillusion surrounding their aims means that Aid for Trade is now more politically apposite than ever. It is in the interests of all countries, developed and advanced developing, to commit funds multilaterally to ensure that the appropriate investments are made in trade-related infrastructure to allow the poorest countries to trade their way out of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the EU – and the Commission in particular – taking a lead on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU put a good deal on the table; we were waiting for serious counter-offers and were sadly disappointed by what came back.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely now is the time for the EU to show moral courage and leadership. Has the Commission considered the potential costs and benefits of the EU unilaterally eliminating all its subsidies and import tariffs on agricultural products and how this might benefit the EU, developing countries and the WTO negotiations?</p>

<p class="contents">We no longer live in a post-war Europe where food security was a legitimate concern. Surely we need to bring the farmers of the EU into the 21st century and show moral leadership in setting dates for the abolition of both subsidies and tariffs so that less-developed countries can benefit with new markets for their produce, EU farmers would become amongst the most efficient in the world, and we would secure the goal of services liberalisation, releasing the talents of Europe onto the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it ends in outright failure, we know what awaits us – a proliferation of regional agreements, which always work to the detriment of the weakest. In other words, this would be at complete variance with our objectives, which are aimed at realigning the rules of international trade in favour of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This Round ought to enable us to deliver a fairer share of the benefits of globalisation and to take account of differences in levels of development. It should also offer developing countries better access to the markets, without forcing their own markets to open up at any price. Of course, there were some shortcomings in these negotiations, but they also delivered progress, as has been pointed out in this debate. This progress, these victories, deserve to be saved and in this respect I welcome the wish expressed by Mr Mandelson. This wish is indispensable, and it is vital that the negotiations be relaunched. Yet making progress also entails reforms, and the question of the reform of the WTO is on the table today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can be no doubt that our basic objective must continue to be the successful completion of the Doha Round negotiations. This will be in the interests of the European Union and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this success cannot be achieved at any cost, nor can it be achieved with unilateral concessions on the part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the time has come for us to answer a crucial question of strategic importance: can the institutional structure of the World Trade Organisation, as we have known it since it was established in 1995, serve the strategic objective of the European Union for a democratic, multilateral trade system? I fear, on the basis of our experience to date and given the failure of the Doha Round negotiations, that it cannot do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Trade Organisation currently generates more crises than it can resolve. That is why I consider the priority for an initiative to be taken on the part of the European Union for a major ambitious democratic reform of the World Trade Organisation to be of strategic importance, just as I consider the need for the European Union to submit an integrated strategic trade policy for the development of bilateral and regional trade relations to be of strategic importance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is exactly what the United States are doing, Mr Mandelson, as you well know; over and above the Doha Round, they are developing their bilateral and regional trade relations. We need to and must do the same.</p>

<p class="contents">I am a new Commissioner and do not know what has happened in the past or what precedent has been set, but I feel instinctively that the information-sharing, consultation and dialogue I have with this Parliament and with the Committee on International Trade is very strong. It is certainly more wide-ranging and frequent and of greater depth than I was used to as a minister in my national parliament. I welcome the depth and strength of those contacts and am slightly surprised by the criticism that has been expressed. I do not know whether it is one representative of Parliament or of the Committee on International Trade as a whole, and I hope it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission consults Parliament on all main trade policy orientations on the basis of the Westerterp Procedure which, as we know, provides for the possibility of a debate in Parliament before the opening of negotiations on any trade agreement, as well as for information from the Council before the conclusion of any such agreement. We do so also on the basis of the Stuttgart Declaration, which states that Parliament should be consulted on the conclusion of all agreements – even ones covered by the then Article 113 – that have an important bearing on the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment to this relationship is shown by the fact that we send the Committee on International Trade copies of all the policy documents that are under discussion in the Council’s Article 133 Committee. There is no legal obligation on us to do this. We do it because it is right and because it helps underpin our relations. No doubt we could do even better in the future, but to characterise what we do at the moment as ‘poor’ or ‘insufficient’ seems inaccurate.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the points raised relate to legitimate concerns over the impact of these negotiations – both their direction and suspension – on developing countries. I should make it clear that developing countries do not conform to a ‘standard size’ state of development or set of interests when it comes to the negotiations. There are different developing countries with very different interests and very different needs. Our job is primarily to ensure two things: firstly, that all developing countries benefit and gain from these negotiations and, secondly, that the weaker, more vulnerable and less-developed among them receive the greatest direct assistance, not least in terms of capacity-building, Aid for Trade and the putting in place of a full duty-free and quota-free system that enables them to access rich world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we operate a system of proportionality: proportionality vis-à-vis what we expect developing countries to contribute and the effort we expect of them in bringing these negotiations to a conclusion, and proportionality also in terms of what we give and how we support and underpin their development. The countries that are in greatest need and have least to offer are quite rightly those which are, and will remain, our priority in these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to stress this because, unlike some of those who have spoken, I passionately believe that a good Doha deal can contribute to development and to fairer trade, through the way in which we operate special and differential treatment between developing countries, the way we allow carve-outs for commitments to developing countries to protect and enable the development of infant industry, the way we provide for longer implementation periods for developing countries so that they can prepare for change and, in particular, the way that we grant special access to the least-developed countries and attention to their capacity needs. We shall continue to adhere to that standard, as you would expect us to do, throughout the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is to have not just access for developing countries to the markets of the developed world, but also much greater access for developing countries to the markets of other developing countries. What is important is South-South trade, especially given the extent of duty-free and quota-free access that we in Europe already give to developing countries and particularly the ACP countries, as a result of which 75% of agricultural exports from Africa come to Europe, as do 45% of those from Latin America. In fact, we are the most open and fair-minded trading bloc in the world. Let us remember that fact, whilst also reminding ourselves of what we can do better in the future. The greatest and earliest gains for developing countries will come from increased trade opportunities with other developing countries. It is therefore South-South trade that we must not lose sight of when delicately and sensitively addressing the issues of tariff reductions and the much-needed multilateralisation of ‘Everything But Arms’.</p>
<p class="contents">Others who have spoken have suggested that far from giving too little for and to developing countries, the European negotiating position has consisted of giving far too much, too early and showing far too much flexibility. Well, we in Europe conceived the Doha Round. We were primarily instrumental in launching it and we have nurtured it throughout. After Cancún we were instrumental in putting it back on track, through the framework agreement, in 2004, and I do not apologise for putting an end date, in Hong Kong, on the elimination of our export subsidies. This was a commitment we had already made, assuming, of course, that we reach the end of these negotiations and that other countries act similarly in eliminating the components of their export subsidisation. I make no apology, and am not actually primarily responsible for the future of the common agricultural policy, although I would point out that I do not as yet see a consensus emerging in favour of its abolition.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of a doubtful outcome to the Doha negotiations, we will have to look very carefully at what happens to the future of export subsidies, because that is linked to another point that has been raised in this debate – i.e. whether or not we will be more or less vulnerable to litigation at the WTO in cases brought against us on agriculture should a deal not be reached in the multilateral negotiations. If these negotiations do not succeed, I agree that it is likely that there will be an upsurge in cases brought to the WTO, especially concerning agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe can view this possibility with relative equanimity. We have reformed our common agricultural policy because it was right to do so for our own purposes and needs, as well as for the needs of others within the international trading system. To the extent that we have now implemented that reform, and will continue to do so, we are protected from litigation at the WTO. However, not all WTO members are in the same position and I certainly do not exclude the big agricultural exporters – for example Brazil and Argentina – trying the judicial road if they see that the political and negotiating one is blocked. However, others are more vulnerable to that than we are in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I make one final comment about timing, let me just say this about the WTO itself. Everybody – including the present Director-General of the WTO – agrees to varying degrees that the WTO would benefit from some institutional and procedural reform, as others have commented on during the course of this debate. The Sutherland Report provided some interesting ideas in this regard. However, we need to be clear in our minds on this. The present impasse in the negotiations is not due to an institutional problem but to a political one, and no institutional improvement could break the present deadlock. That is something which requires political will and an adjustment of attitude and policy on the part of certain WTO members.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my last point, which relates to when these negotiations can restart. Quite simply, we will have to wait until the mid-term elections in the United States are over in November before we can entertain the idea of a serious resumption in negotiations. I will be working to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
