<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bontempi </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, today's sitting is an important one, not only for our committee, which has been working on these matters for months, but above all – I hope – for the European people. This thorough groundwork – resulting in the reports which I hope the House will adopt – for the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Tampere, which is to lay down the guidelines for future EU policy on security and justice, is a most important contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone realises that the greatest innovation of the Amsterdam Treaty – due to enter into force a few days from now, on 1 May – is the ‘area of freedom, security and justice', a brand new concept which constitutes a major step forward for the Union, following the establishment of a single currency and the attempts to launch a policy on employment. Indeed, to involve the Union in fulfilling such fundamental requirements as freedom, security and justice is, firstly, to recognise the close linkage between these three requirements, none of which can be fulfilled without the other two – after all, freedom is only meaningful in a secure environment, based on a reliable legal system – and, secondly, to regard the Union as the appropriate framework for the protection and furtherance of such values, irrespective of individual legal traditions or practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The other merit of this new and innovative part of the Treaty is that it is fundamentally, explicitly and clearly based on protection, promotion and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms. By expressly recalling these principles and, what is more, setting out a procedure for calling to order Member States which fail to respect them, the Fifteen have finally laid the foundations for a European public order, for which the European Convention on Human Rights is the handbook and the area of freedom, security and justice the most obvious expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we really are facing a significant turning‐point in the life of the Union. Our concern, owing to the pitfalls dotted throughout the Treaty itself in the numerous clauses and the usual complex structure, is that in order to achieve the anticipated results in this field, all the institutions will have to engage in a fully‐fledged war, or perhaps battle. I say this because our task is complicated by the surviving distinction between the first and third pillars and of unanimous voting within the Council, plus the weakness of parliamentary control both nationally and in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This report has already been discussed at a conference with the national parliaments, with representatives of governments and of European civil society, and a broad measure of consensus has, I believe, been achieved. The report is the result of intense cooperation among the political groups; I should especially like to draw attention to the amendments on which we shall be voting tomorrow, almost all of them making significant improvements, put forward by Mrs Palacio on behalf of the PPE Group. I think we were right to work together in this way, since much is expected of us and we must uphold certain principles: solidarity – the Member States must cooperate in this field, since only by doing so and by overcoming national apathy and egoism will we achieve our aim; a commitment to transparency, which must apply to the conduct of all parties, including the Council; and, in a clear break with tradition, a commitment to full participation in the decision‐making process. Only recently, Parliament's role – a key role in the democratic process but also a factor of efficiency – was still being ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say in conclusion that this report represents a call for guarantees and effectiveness. The Council has to understand that, when it comes to sensitive matters concerning citizenship and legality, unless there is ample cooperation not only with the European Parliament but also with national parliaments and civil society, it will be hard to make our existing array of virtual laws comprehensible and meaningful to the people.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Nassauer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europol will finally begin its work on 1 July, by which time approximately four years will have passed since the legal basis for a European Police Office was laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. For Europol these have been four difficult years during which its establishment has been delayed and obstructed, not least because of so‐called national sovereignty. And I fear that these four years of national sovereignty have served no purpose whatsoever. The fact that Europol could not begin its work, however, has undoubtedly given organised crime in Europe a further advantage. For this reason we want Europol not only to be able to begin work on 1 July but also to be able to work effectively from this date. The European Parliament supports the work that is due to begin on 1 July.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in its first report the European Parliament was cautiously in favour of extending Europol"s powers. We proposed considering giving it operational powers. This does not mean a European FBI that could take responsibility for prosecution, nor does it mean armed and uniformed Europol officers arresting criminals. None of this is part of Europol"s tasks. What we mean is that Europol should have the power to coordinate cross‐border investigations responsibly and the accompanying right to issue instructions to national police authorities. This is the cautious path that the European Parliament has chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for this not because we are blindly demanding policing rights for Europe but because these demands are in line with policing needs. If organised crime is planned, organised and carried out centrally, it makes sense that we should equip ourselves with a prosecution authority that also plans and acts centrally. This is why we need Europol. Any police authorities which have the right to encroach on citizens" rights need parliamentary controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol is currently a purely intergovernmental organisation, and as a result the European Parliament has no powers of supervision. Under the Treaty we are to be given only occasional and limited information, but we cannot exercise controls. Monitoring Europol is therefore clearly the task of the national parliaments, and I can only call upon our counterparts in the national parliaments to do their duty here. This is also appropriate as things stand at present. In the area of data processing Europol has only very limited rights of intervention, but there are now almost universal demands that Europol"s rights be extended. The Treaty of Amsterdam, which will enter into force in only a matter of days, points in this direction. The President‐in‐Office surprised us here only a few weeks ago when he called for Europol to have operational powers to take action. If that is the case we must certainly review the issue of parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of Europol being controlled by 15 national parliaments in The Hague is totally unrealistic. We also do not want some parliament to be constantly looking over Europol"s shoulder in The Hague to see what it is doing, as this would also be nonsense. However, parliamentary control means that this police unit must be placed under the responsibility of a political body that in turn must be answerable to parliament. This is what parliamentary control means. So if Europol acquires new powers – as we hope – we need a Commissioner who is responsible for Europol, and the task of monitoring this body must be transferred to the European Parliament. Only on this condition, rather than in any event, do we call for new rights for Europol. In other words, we call for these rights only if parliamentary control is possible. That is what we are insisting on in this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wiebenga </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, the Tampere summit on European justice policy in October 1999 cannot afford to fail. The people of Europe want to feel safe, in their European Union which has open borders. The Union must give a sign that the problem of major crime is now being tackled. Things have to change. Since the Maastricht Treaty came into force – in November 1993, that is to say five years ago – those five years have been almost totally wasted. Europol, as we have heard, is not yet powerful enough. It is a weak instrument of judicial cooperation. The fight against fraud is not being won, and so on. In short, Europe needs to grasp the nettle of major crime in Tampere. It is time for us to get back to work.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to have a single European area of justice, and that may take shape, for example, through a network for legal actions brought by national authorities. A network for the courts, too, by strengthening Europol. My report likewise describes a part of this European area of justice. It looks at two issues which are important above all for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is the need for a number of penalties to be harmonised. These are the penalties applied to organised crime such as drugs trafficking, trafficking in human beings, terrorism, fraud, corruption and the like. We need to harmonise these penalties, this limited number of criminal acts. Just compare the work done by Europol, which is responsible specifically for detection work in these areas. If justice is to be done here, the Member States must apply the same penalties Europe‐wide. But at the same time I should say that we do not of course want a European penal code. Criminal law must remain primarily a part of Member States" own policy, but a limited number of international, cross‐border crimes must, as I say, be harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of my report concerns the creation of a European public prosecutor"s office. This would coordinate the prosecution of the crimes I have just mentioned. You cannot say that police forces must cooperate, through Europol for example, and then say that the forces of justice should not do so. Prosecution of these international crimes has to be coordinated as well. A second task which a European public prosecutor"s office might perform in the distant future must be the exercise of judicial scrutiny over Europol. There is none, indeed there is no democratic scrutiny, as has become apparent. The same will apply when OLAF replaces UCLAF as an independent anti‐fraud body: judicial scrutiny will be needed there, and this can be performed by the European public prosecutor"s office.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with these serious crimes, I would also like to say a word about Mrs d"Ancona"s related report on drugs policy. This contains an interesting paragraph 10 which suggests that the drugs debate in Europe should be ‘de‐ideologised". Member States are unmistakeably growing closer together here along the lines of a policy on drugs, prevention of drug use, combating drugs trafficking and treating drug dependency. Taking the ideology out of the drugs debate means that we must stop talking about decriminalising drugs. We must press on steadily for more and more harmonisation in drugs policy. If Mrs d"Ancona is ready to go down this road, we shall have achieved a great deal at this part‐session.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be a radical change in the way the European Council works and thinks. After Tampere, we must have total democracy. All proposed measures in the justice field must be brought before the European Parliament. There has to be more openness and transparency. The national parliaments must be involved in European justice policy and lastly, and I say this from the Liberal point of view, we need to have a European Commissioner with responsibility for this area, and one who has muscle. If we get all this, Tampere will have been a success.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schmid </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for many people the Internet has allowed access to a wealth of stored information. In social terms it could almost be described as a revolution, one in which participation in knowledge is made generally accessible. The Internet is therefore something positive and cannot be blamed simply because, like other instruments of communication, it is misused for the purpose of criminal activities. No one would dream of saying that the telephone is something bad just because criminals also use it.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the criminal activities found on the Internet is the trade in and exchange of child pornography material. The alarming thing about child pornography is not the fact that it is pornography, in other words that it involves images of naked people involved in sexual acts. When this takes place among adults it is not a criminal offence. I find it disgusting but there are people who do like it. The reason child pornography has been made a criminal offence is that it involves the portrayal of real live children being sexually abused. That is what is disturbing about it. In the interest of children, therefore, prosecution must continue to be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course trading and exchanging child pornography material existed in the past, before the Internet was introduced. It is nothing new. But it was difficult for individuals to find a supplier since things that are against the law cannot be advertised publicly. What is new is the possibility, via the Internet, to supply and trade worldwide, and to do so under conditions that make prosecution considerably more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore right that the Member States have proposed joint action, on the basis of Article K.3 of the Maastricht Treaty, to combat child pornography on the Internet more effectively. However, the proposal is full of phrases talking about having to look into things or referring to possible courses of action. Hardly any concrete or binding decisions are taken. This reminds me of the remark attributed to the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef, who is believed to have once said ‘Gentlemen, something must be done, but nothing must be changed!" This is a good description of the present Council proposal. The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has therefore tried, by means of amendments, to make the non‐binding phrases in the text binding so that there is some point to all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are two places where we are trying to make it possible to prosecute such acts on the Internet. Two problems arise in dealing with the prosecution of child pornography. The first is that there is no uniform protective age for children, which makes it incredibly difficult in the case of cross‐border investigations.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">d"Ancona </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> A few comments, Mr President, to add to my report on the Council report on a post−1999 European Union drugs strategy. I will start on a positive note. For the first time, we have seen the Committee on Civil Liberties able to approve a report on drugs virtually unanimously – it was unanimous really, but for one abstention. That says something about the fact that, by virtue of having listened to one another over the years, we have at least made a start on taking ideology out of the debate on drugs. I think that is a good thing. In this instance it was rather easier, because as rapporteur I did not have to talk about a completely new drugs policy, but was able simply to give a verdict on the strategy first mooted under the UK Presidency. My committee was unanimous in agreeing with that verdict.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, we thought that under Article K.6 of the EU Treaty and given the codecision procedure, we should have been consulted beforehand. We thought too that the Council should have drawn on Parliament"s various pronouncements on dugs. We have already adopted so many reports on drugs over the years that the Council should have looked at them. There is not really any sign that they did so. We thought too that account should have been taken of the findings of an evaluation study, because we now have the excellent monitoring centre for drugs. How can you draw up a new strategy if you have no idea what the effects were of the old strategy followed between 1995 and 1999? So we were highly critical on that count.</p>
<p class="contents">Stranger still is the fact that the Commission will be unveiling its 2000‐2005 action plan on drugs any day now, when we in Parliament do not know exactly what the relationship is between the Council"s plan and that of the Commission. From what I have heard, the Commission plan is in any event more ambitious than that of the Council. I hope that will prove to be the case; it is the impression I have formed from one thing and another.</p>
<p class="contents">These criticisms have of course prompted us to make a number of recommendations. We think there has to be better coordination of policy on drugs, and our committee has adopted an amendment to the effect that in the near future we want to see a Commissioner given responsibility for coordinating drugs policy within the Commission. I think the current Commissioner will also have had a hard time of it, given that the responsibility was spread so widely. Both for us and the Commission, it would have been better if just one Commissioner, Mrs Gradin for example, had been the Commissioner responsible for coordinating policy on drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">A second recommendation I would mention is that we feel strongly that better use should be made of the European monitoring centre. I find it absurd that the Council does not draw on research findings. And it would be a good idea, now that the Council and the Commission – perhaps both of them – are drawing up a new and coordinated strategy, if meanwhile we were to build in fixed reference points, reference points which will allow us to see later whether the strategy has worked well, in which respects it did not work well or worked poorly.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also advocated better and more intelligent use of the UNDCP in providing substitute crops, not by destroying drug harvests in third world countries, but by adopting an integrated approach to development which offers a real alternative to poor people in those countries. There are some good examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have done our best, myself as rapporteur but above all the committee as a whole, to strike a balance between prevention and information, reducing the risks to health and the opportunities provided by a coordinated approach on justice. In accepting amendments, I am keen to preserve that balance. So I shall not comment on whether or not I like some of the amendments. I think the balance we have struck needs to be preserved in the plenary too – a balance which will be established in practice if the Member States can pool their practical experience as far as possible.</p>

The Committee on Institutional Affairs, on whose behalf I am speaking here today, sees these as much more than weak points. In fact, it sees them as critical developments for civil rights, the rule of law and the role of Parliament in the area of internal security. I believe it is important to draw the attention of the House to this today.</p>
<p class="contents">Our criticism applies even to the way in which Parliament is being consulted, which is unfortunately nothing new. The Commission shows little intention of involving Parliament in any serious way in this vital issue. In a letter of 9 December 1998 we were asked to deliver an opinion, but the Council of Justice Ministers had already adopted the action plan on 3 December. Here consultation becomes a farce, and the inclusion of Parliament nothing other than a pretence.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second criticism concerns the Treaty of Amsterdam itself, which says little or nothing about the institutional framework in which the freedom of movement for persons is to be realised. On the implementation of the Schengen Agreement there is merely a protocol. The crucial question of whether the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> should be incorporated in the first or third pillar, in accordance with Article 4 or Article 6, has not been settled. This has serious implications for the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and for Parliament"s right of codecision after five years, and there are also serious implications for the budget. The whole question of the legal status of Schengen has not even been settled yet. As the preparations show today, the Council seems to have no desire to choose the democratic, constitutional method, with the full involvement of the Court of Justice and the European Parliament. I believe these are not weak points but truly dangerous developments for the rule of law and for democracy.</p>

<p class="contents">I am going to be somewhat more positive than my colleague Mr Voggenhuber and I am also going to mention a point that was raised by Mr Bontempi. Indeed, I would like to thank Mr Bontempi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for his cooperation, and in a moment I will also have the opportunity of thanking him on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bontempi said that what we are dealing with is a very complex structure. What this actually means is that we have to incorporate Title IV on visas, asylum and the free movement of persons; a substantial part of what remains under the third pillar; the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> through the relevant protocol; and the special protocols. It could not be any more complex.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the major challenge we must face if – as Mr Bontempi also pointed out – we want the European Union to change for the better and become a Union that represents guarantees and efficiency, citizenship and lawfulness. We are ready to meet that challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs stressed the importance of the following issues, which are also covered in Mr Bontempi"s report: the right to a fair trial with all assurances, the guarantee of access to justice – which should include granting aid where those involved cannot afford to go to court – and the presumption of innocence as a fundamental principle of European law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs also highlighted an issue that has been mentioned in other reports: the need to monitor jurisdiction. It is possible that during this very complex process, we may pay less attention to monitoring jurisdiction. We must therefore ensure that such a measure is taken and we must also demand that Parliament be given the right to exercise democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not exercise democratic control and monitor jurisdiction, we will never get past the stage where Europe is simply a market and we will be unable to rise to the challenge we are now facing.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elliott </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, we have a group of five reports and I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs. They have all done a very good job in producing reports which make an important contribution to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like first of all to focus on the justice and home affairs area which is covered by Mr Bontempi's and Mr Wiebenga's reports. They make a valuable contribution by stressing the need for the European Union to achieve a greater degree of harmonisation and of cooperation in this area. It is an area that has been sadly neglected compared with the great strides which the Union has made in harmonisation in the fields of economic and financial policy, agriculture, transport, the environment, etc. This area of justice and home affairs and freedom has lagged far behind. It is not that we want every country to adopt the same legal and judicial system – that would be absurd. Indeed, even within certain regions of existing Member States there are long‐standing differences in the way that the law is administered and operated.</p>
<p class="contents">We need much greater cooperation. We are facing a situation where we have a proliferation of organised crime on an international basis. The criminals do not worry about issues of subsidiarity and frontier controls and whether the niceties of national law versus European law are properly abided by – they operate in whatever way makes them the biggest profit and achieves their objectives. Unless we are able to establish a proper system of international cooperation in this area then we will not be able to deal effectively with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also important in order to protect the rights of individuals. There is a tremendous disparity in criminal and indeed in civil law. There are many activities which are criminal in some countries but not in others. Sentencing policy varies widely. This is becoming more and more important as greater numbers of our citizens and residents of the European Union are working, living and carrying out their activities in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that somebody should have fewer legal rights if they are charged with an offence in a country other than their own than they would in their own country. Furthermore, problems have arisen of people being held for long periods without trial because of bureaucratic delays caused by translation problems and because of the lack of proper legal aid. These matters must be tackled and resolved, and the reports suggest some very important and useful ways in which that can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nassauer's report on Europol has the balance right. We must have effective collaboration between national police forces, and the Europol Convention provides for the proper and effective exchange of information to enable the police forces of our Member States to cooperate and to act more effectively by proper interchange of information, ideas and practices. Without this, police forces operating in the sphere of law and order will be working with one hand tied behind their backs compared with the criminal organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing Parliament has always stressed from the very inception of Europol is that any international police organisation – perhaps in the course of time with operational powers, however limited they may be – can only be allowed to exist if there is a proper system of democratic control and accountability – just as we would expect proper democratic accountability by our own national police forces. We must respect the principle that policing can take place only with the consent of the communities being served. Police forces that see themselves as some kind of external force coming in to impose rules and operations which are not acceptable to the community at large will fail. We need good effective policing with the consent of the communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs d'Ancona's report on the complex and vexed area of drugs balances very difficult issues: the question of not condoning the use of dangerous drugs but, at the same time, recognising that a purely punitive approach to this issue will never succeed and that there must be proper emphasis on education, health matters and so on. It is a good balanced approach to this issue.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cederschiöld </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by touching briefly on Mr Wiebenga's report on criminal procedures (Corpus Juris). It is an excellent report which deals with a particularly sensitive and neglected area. The report should be seen as a step on the road towards increased coordination of criminal law in the EU, which is something that is desirable. At the same time, certain differences in the Member States' legal systems must be respected in any coordination process. It is emphasised in the report that national legal traditions should be respected, thereby enabling the Corpus Juris project to proceed on a realistic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate also includes Mr Bontempi's report concerning an action plan on an area of freedom, security and justice, and I have nothing but good to say about it. It includes all our main prerequisites from a legal point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to move on to Mrs d'Ancona's more controversial report on the EU's strategies in the battle against drugs. I am pleased that we have succeeded in persuading the Social Democrats to agree that the drugs issue is sufficiently important to be discussed in plenary, so that our citizens are kept informed. The report specifically reflects the idea that it really is a battle against drugs – and that means all drugs. Such an approach ought to underlie the strategy which the Commission is drawing up. The very long drawn‐out and intensive discussions on drugs which have taken place during the present term have shown where the boundaries of cooperation lie in this area. The committee has scored a notable success in that the report makes no further mention of prescribing heroin as a means of combating drug abuse. But nor is prescribing methadone for drug addicts a satisfactory way of helping them to overcome their dependency. We therefore regard the development of less addictive alternatives to methadone as a hopeful sign which should resolve the remaining political difficulties in terms of the way in which the majority in the House views the drugs issue. The ultimate objective is, of course, the total eradication of all dependency on drugs and pharmaceutical preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of the PPE Group has been successful. Mrs d'Ancona, the rapporteur, has been very willing to cooperate and listen to our point of view. I should therefore like to praise, in particular, her perceptiveness as regards the appropriate approach to take in the area of drugs. The report before us today is significantly more balanced than previous proposals. The debate in Parliament has played an important role. To begin with, we adopted a very different position from everyone else, but now we have arrived at a common European approach. Those of us who come from the Nordic countries have succeeded in gaining sympathy for some of the basic common principles we apply in combating drugs‐related problems in our countries. The report conveys a clear message about the actions required to reduce supply and demand. My long‐term goal is a drugs‐free society, and I believe that the fight against drugs in Europe in the future will be underpinned by the same three basic elements that we in Sweden have for so long held to be essential in the battle against drugs, namely prevention, repression and rehabilitation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Frischenschlager </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, firstly we must thank all the rapporteurs for their work, as these reports deal with an area at the very heart of European values, namely the principle of the rule of law. I believe it is very important that we remind ourselves that social mobility and the integration of the people of Europe must be accompanied by harmonisation of the law. In my opinion, therefore, it is not a disadvantage but in fact important that we should bring our civil law and in particular our criminal law into line in response to the fact that we in Europe are living increasingly close together.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it important that we place great emphasis on legal culture not being lost in practice. This applies in particular to future members in Central and Eastern Europe. We are already seeing in the accession talks and preparations that it is very difficult there to identify, support or promote a legal culture that allows people to live together in a common economic and legal framework and in an area of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to fundamental rights, I would say the following. Mr Nassauer referred to Europol. It is very important for us to have effective policing instruments, but they must be accompanied by judicial and parliamentary monitoring instruments. In my view it is not enough that only the national parliaments should fulfil this role. The European Court of Justice and in future also the European Parliament should have a very crucial monitoring function here.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the right of asylum. It is very important for Europe to be open and we must ensure that asylum does not fall by the wayside. We must also ensure that the burden is shared fairly within the European Community. The right of asylum must be considered as a sacred European value. We will not tolerate anything less.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR HAARDER<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Andrews </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, today's debate is timely as the 50th Eurobarometer report which has just been published clearly shows that concerns about unemployment are only just higher than the citizens' desire for action against drugs and crime. I want to say straight away that I do not support the resolution calling for the appointment of an independent European public prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it must be safe for European citizens to walk in their neighbourhoods. It must be safe to do business in Europe without fear of financial fraud. It must be safe for children to attend school without fear of being lured into drugs. It must be safe for children to use the information highway and not be abused by deviants using the Internet for pornographic purposes. Paedophilia on the Internet must be prosecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, in line with the commitment entered into in the Amsterdam Treaty, must become an area of freedom, security and justice where citizens enjoy a high level of safety. Next October governments will hold a special meeting to consider the establishment of a European area of freedom, security and justice. They must put forward a common strategy which recognises and responds to the clearly established demands of our European citizens for action against drugs and crime. Organised crime operates at a professional level. It has enormous resources and access to the latest technology, which it can use to subvert democracy and for the purposes of money laundering and fraud. It is essential that police cooperation in connection with Europol be extended to new areas such as counterfeiting Euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that convicted drug barons should be given a minimum forty‐year jail sentence in view of the fact that the European Union does not have the death penalty. The European Union must be equally professional and use all its combined forces to tackle these crime barons throughout the European Union. As far as possible serious crime must carry penalties which result in long jail terms. In my own constituency in Dublin only this weekend I have seen a family who have lost two young women during the last year as a result of drug abuse. It must be one of the priorities of the European Union to tackle drugs. There is no point in people coming into this House and talking about liberal proposals when you look around and see young people dying from drug abuse, while the people who import and sell these drugs are getting away scot‐free. We must give every cooperation to Europol and do everything we can to prevent this drug abuse.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ceyhun </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer, has already said, parliamentary supervision of Europol"s police activities of is one of the most important tasks of this House, particularly for us as politicians concerned with home affairs. For this reason we in the Green Group in the European Parliament consider it to be very important that Europol, as an intergovernmental organisation, does not acquire any additional powers that would be inconceivable for our national police authorities and that violate the rights of EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">An example is the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol. Of course we are in favour of Europol as a European authority that is necessary for the internal security of the European Union and plays a crucial role in cooperation between national police authorities. But we are in favour of a European authority that can be democratically controlled. Police activity needs to be supervised above all in areas where it interferes with civil rights, especially fundamental rights. For this reason we are not satisfied with the current supervision of Europol that is supposedly carried out by the national parliaments. Mr Nassauer has made some good proposals, which we welcome. But they are not sufficient. In our opinion it is very important that parliamentary supervision of Europol"s police activities should be carried out by the European Parliament, but there are unfortunately still no proposals that would allow us to exercise genuine control.</p>

I would like to take a moment to look at the report by Mr Bontempi as, in my view, it is extremely important and it covers almost all the areas that still require work in this process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the communitarisation of judicial and police cooperation, all the points highlighted are of fundamental importance. These include reducing the length of asylum procedures, establishing conditions and procedures for issuing visas, moving towards a uniform visa, defining a statute for legal immigrants, and effectively combating illegal immigration. We are also very much in favour of the free movement of legal immigrants between the Member States. We will finally be able to guarantee that all decisions are taken impartially and, above all, that those most directly affected can have complete peace of mind.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as police cooperation is concerned, the development of Europol and the use of databases are vital. It is also essential to eventually incorporate the Schengen information system into Europol"s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, many countries are still reluctant to allow the judicial authorities of one Member State to operate in the territory of another Member State. We need to resolve this issue and move towards a general harmonisation of our laws on most offences and crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, we believe that freedom is the most important aspect, and we will have to integrate the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into our own operations. Two key objectives must be retained. The first will involve dealing with the crisis we are experiencing in Europe today, that is, the incidences of mass immigration, by collectively offering temporary protection on a large scale to those who are the victims of persecution. In any event, the right of asylum must be based, now and in the future, on the fundamental legislation we already have, in other words the Geneva Convention and the other protocols. Finally, as far as security is concerned, we need to combat organised crime and eradicate the living conditions that have given rise to violence in our cities and hooliganism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a brief word about the report by Mrs d"Ancona on the use of illegal substances. It is interesting to note that it in no way calls into question the policy pursued up to now in relation to the use of these substances, which has yet to produce any convincing results, and that is the least we might say about it. The collective progress made have not been taken into account and no consideration given to the assessment of the experiments currently under way. A certain degree of caution and a conservative attitude were adopted and resulted in an agreement on the lowest common denominator. Realism has, however, now prevailed in favour of a multisectoral approach.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Seillier </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, the report by our colleague Mr Schmid raises some very valid points and puts forward some excellent ideas, particularly the proposal to prohibit the sending of anonymous e‐mail.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion, this report has one fundamental flaw: it makes a distinction between pornography that is supposed to be acceptable and child pornography, which is the only type that is supposed to be reprehensible. I refuse to accept this.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it claims that the problem of identifying the age of a child is extremely delicate and that there is no solution. However, ladies and gentlemen, it is pornography itself – just like racism and other evils we quite rightly condemn – that must be looked on as an attack on human dignity and respect, which form one of the cornerstones of our democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, how are we going to arrest those involved in child pornography who are so unbalanced as to end up actually committing the act because of having constantly watched pornographic tapes involving adults? There is a certain lack of realism here and I have great difficulty in making any sense of it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the report by our colleague Mrs d"Ancona, again I am not going to look at this matter in terms of its many economic problems and the distinction between the crackdown on traffickers, which must be ruthless, and the approach focusing basically on young people, since it is a very delicate issue as far as they are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, I will look at an aspect that, to my mind, is vital and that does not receive enough attention. We are told that we must look at the issue from the supply side and this is certainly true. But why do young people use drugs? How have we failed? Adults throughout Europe must examine their consciences, be they parents, teachers, social leaders or, in fact, any adults that come into contact with young people, in other words all of us. We must ask ourselves why we have not managed to provide our young people with reasons to live, with the desire to live, and with the moral strength to face the difficulties we all encounter throughout our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Life on earth has always been very difficult. There is a basic problem here that should lead us to work together and on that level. In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to a particular point: we are constantly talking about language teaching, but from an increasingly utilitarian point of view. Instead, if we made literature, the great literature of all our European countries, accessible to young people once again, it would perhaps set them on the right track and prevent them from getting involved in drugs and other such behaviour.</p>

Yet it has still not been set up. The preparatory work has not yet progressed far enough to allow it to become fully operational in The Hague. Of course we are all interested in a functional Europol as an appropriate weapon against organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">It is generally recognised that we need an effective instrument in the fight against crime that is increasing particularly in qualitative terms. However, instead of vehemently demanding that the preparatory work be concluded, today we are discussing a development that goes too far and, in our opinion, in the wrong direction. The security aspect does not require Europol officers to be given the right to issue instructions to national officers, not does it require the setting‐up of a central European body. For these reasons we reject the report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party and I think that at this stage we need to take a clear look at the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European conscience is clearly experiencing a significant and undoubtedly serious crisis at the moment. Public opinion has developed in our Member States to the point where people now want much more than the plan that limited European integration to the completion of the single market. I do not think there is any doubt today that the people of Europe hope and believe that rather than being just a common market, Europe is a project for civilization.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not want to have to mention the recent situation in Kosovo and the need for Europe to assert itself on the international stage, but I think that it is unavoidable. However, for Europe to assert itself in this way, we must ensure that Europe is clearly defined and consolidated internally: it cannot be just a market.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic process in the Member States is extremely demanding and we, as representatives of the people, must be aware that through our work, with this Bontempi report and with the four reports that are also being debated today, we must take the Treaty of Amsterdam to its legal limit. The Treaty of Amsterdam is clearly our legal framework, but we must take it as far as we can in terms of the legal scope it offers. And, where this is not sufficient, we must make a clear commitment to change the Treaty in order to meet what has become an obvious demand from the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere summit is therefore very important, since the Member States are going to tackle all these issues at the very highest level. The report by Mr Bontempi is significant because it defines what we are actually hoping for in terms of the area of freedom, security and justice that is currently proposed by the Treaty. The Tampere summit is going to put this all into practice, and the Bontempi report sets out certain fundamental ideas here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would naturally like to thank Mr Bontempi for his kind words about me. I must say that I had the benefit of the fullest cooperation during my work on this document and I am as proud as he is of the final result, which I hope will receive the support of the majority of the House tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we must clearly define the fundamental rights we want to have and determine at what legal level we want them to be established. We want to put an end to discrimination and we hope that a sense of European citizenship can be developed. We also feel that issues such as the free movement of persons, visas and immigration – and I am not going to go back over the events that are taking place at the moment – all need to be resolved as soon as possible if we want to make any progress on the objective set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, we must improve the public"s access to justice. They must feel that they are protected by all the legal systems throughout Europe, rather than believing that, as far as justice is concerned, there is no difference between being involved in a legal dispute with a French citizen than with a citizen of any other country in the world, as someone in Spain once said to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must change our working methods and the way in which the institutions cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the main issues covered in the Bontempi report.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the other reports, which relate to the three cornerstones of freedom, security and justice, and I would stress how important they are.</p>

<p class="contents">The very way in which the reports are divided gives the impression that the challenges we face are fragmented. Yet there is no doubt that we are dealing with the very crux of European integration and the European project to build a community of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bontempi"s report leaves me with the impression of a form of European citizenship that evolves progressively, almost in stages, through the positive step of establishing a number of freedoms, but also – and we have already seen this in the progress made on the free movement of persons – by creating a new category: the Community citizen who is no longer a complete foreigner in any of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of fragmentation is heightened when we see that certain concepts are ignored, particularly the concept of secularism. This is at the heart of European citizenship as defined by the Treaty of Amsterdam through fundamental rights that transcend any division into categories, beliefs, dogmas, ethnic groups or religions. In Europe, we are building an area of freedom and citizenship which goes further than that and which is much more important. That is precisely what the founding fathers of republican secularism hoped to do: they wanted to tear our people away from concentrating on their separate identities and to instead focus their attention on the universal nature of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would just like to say that it is unfortunate that this basic dimension of secularism is not dealt with in detail in such an important debate.</p>

Where is all this leading? According to the reports we are debating, the EU should extend its legal competence to include, amongst other things, an EU statute which would legitimise its activities and create a European identity. The powers of the Court of Justice should be increased. There should be greater harmonisation of civil and criminal law and in defining criminal activities. Europol is a European police force and, as such, should be given operational powers and the ability to issue instructions to national police authorities. The establishment of a European public prosecutor is also seen as desirable, and the reports go further still.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that these sensitive issues, which concern the very essence of each Member State – in other words national sovereignty – and which are the subject of constitutional law in the different countries, have not been debated properly by the people. It would create havoc if one were to ride roughshod in this way over both the people and national parliaments. Why have we not got the courage here in Parliament to speak plainly, to hold debates, to send out signals that a majority in this House would like to create a ‘United States of Europe' and then to debate the issue with the people and the national parliaments – even though I myself am naturally against such a development.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mrs d"Ancona's report on drugs, from a Swedish viewpoint it is a slight improvement on many of the others we have discussed. Nevertheless, I have tabled four amendments which I hope the House and the Commission will support, in particular Amendment No 2.</p>

Mr Nassauer rightly points to Europol"s lack of accountability. I believe the answer to this lies with the national parliaments and the Council. Broadening Europol and giving it police powers amongst other things seems to me a very bad idea, in view of the problems we have at present with scrutiny and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Wiebenga"s very clear report, the creation of an open Europe without internal borders has indeed prompted the need for partial harmonisation of our criminal laws. The report itself rightly says that we do not want a European penal code. Less logically, however, the rapporteur advocates a European public prosecutor"s office. A solution which goes as far as that is not at all necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I can be brief as regards the Schmid report: I wholeheartedly endorse it. I have a good deal of difficulty, however, with the report by Mr Bontempi. In a torrent of words, he covers all manner of widely divergent issues. He stridently asserts that public opinion is outraged by the absence of European legislation in all manner of areas and the supposed dismantling of national legal systems. The fact that he quotes this as a cause of organised crime and social problems is truly appalling. There is no pressing public demand for something like European citizenship. For freedom, security and justice, yes. The way that is achieved is of little interest to most people. To say that it can only be achieved through European policy is simply daft.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example is a Union charter of human rights. The point of this completely escapes me, unless you want a European constitution as the first step towards a European state. There is much more I could mention, but suffice it to say that I shall not be voting for this text, which is one‐sided, in some parts strident and in any case muddled.</p>

The amendments tabled are therefore a significant improvement. The increasing and totally unrestricted distribution of contemptible paedophile images and activities via the Internet is turning modern information technology from a blessing for humanity into a curse. Professional crime in the area of child abuse and misuse of the Internet can only be combated successfully if the EU takes joint action and if the Member States in particular cooperate more closely with each other and with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for this is it necessary to harmonise certain concepts in criminal law such as age limits, otherwise totally absurd situations can arise. For example, a German national sentenced in Belgium to five years in prison for child abuse is currently living freely in Germany and cannot be extradited because the crime he committed in Belgium is not an offence in Germany because the age limits in the two countries are different.</p>

We have had many debates here on drugs, some of which have been extremely intensive and emotional. I must say that the d"Ancona report is a great improvement on the reports we have discussed before. In my view, it prepares the ground for an objective discussion on a future drugs policy. It does not mean, however, that in future there will be agreement on all the details. I do not think that will be possible, since we all come from different countries with different traditions. In my opinion, for example, we sometimes set too much store by ‘harm reduction', while I would prefer the emphasis to be placed on timely intervention and preventive actions. However, I have to acknowledge that I agree with nearly all the rapporteur's views, for example that one of the Commissioners should be given the task of trying to find alternatives to imprisonment, which has already been shown to be an unsatisfactory solution to drugs‐related problems. I also think that we should carry out an evaluation of the methods currently used to deal with the problems – we know that some methods are better than others, but there has been no proper evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think we should be proud of one particular matter where the joint efforts of Parliament and the Commission have met with success during this period, namely in combating synthetic drugs. If we have achieved anything through our common efforts during this parliamentary term, then it is to have begun this very important task of combating synthetic drugs. I should like to thank my colleagues in both Parliament and the Commission for that.</p>

In the first block I would like to look at the problem of drugs. There is a simple reason for this: currently more than 5 million young people in the European Union are taking synthetic drugs. Overall, it is clear from all the reports that drug consumption and the trade in drugs are unfortunately increasing spectacularly. We need effective anti‐drugs strategies in the European Union, but our problem here is that because we try to do so many different things as part of our strategies people do not always really know what is going on. The anti‐drugs strategies come under three pillars; we have several action plans and a variety of reports on the drugs problem. We urgently need to adopt a single position and recognisable strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address a number of points which I believe are essential. Firstly, we should send out a signal by trying where possible not to talk about drugs strategies but about anti‐drugs strategies. This also applies to all reports on the subject. Secondly, we must support what we have decided here in the long term, in other words in future there must still be no liberalisation or legalisation of the production, sale or consumption of drugs. The future of the European Union must not be one where hashish is sold in tobacconists and heroin is given on prescription. This must never become a reality for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must remove ideology from our drugs debate. We need pragmatic, effective solutions ranging from prevention through repression to support for addicts. However, I think that we should concentrate our prevention efforts on schools, because there we can reach all the young people of the European Union. I would propose yet again that we should promote voluntary measures, and the Commissioner has also kindly promised support here. So schools in Europe should be declared drug‐free zones on a voluntary basis. Cooperation with the chemicals industry, for example in combating precursors, should be improved and increased. With regard to repression, the aim must be to extend Europol, support the police, promote judicial cooperation and generally to introduce help for addicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europe must be seen in all its strategies to be a Community of security. I have no fears in this respect when I look at reports such as those by Mr Nassauer and Mr Wiebenga. These call for strong measures and I am hoping for further strong measures at the Tampere summit.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blak </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, this can be said quite simply. The idea of introducing a common European public prosecutor should be scrapped. We should not have a common European criminal law or public prosecutor. We can fight crime just as effectively with the existing instruments, including Europol and the convention on extradition and mutual judicial assistance. We can easily strengthen cooperation between Member States on investigations and the pursuit of justice, without necessarily having completely uniform rules and a European public prosecutor. We should not harmonise for the sake of harmonising, and in fact the differences between the criminal laws of the Member States are not so great that they cannot be overcome by using existing intergovernmental instruments. We can easily ensure effective investigations without handing them over to supranational authorities. Europol is a good example of the fact that this is possible, and Europol should remain intergovernmental. It must not develop into a European police authority with operational powers. The Nassauer report proposes that Europol should be put under the direction and control of the Commission, with strengthened supervisory powers for the European Parliament. That is a very bad idea. Formally speaking, parliamentary supervision of Europol is well placed in the hands of the national parliaments, although one might doubt that they themselves are aware of it, so it is perhaps a good idea to also report to the European Parliament, which takes its supervisory role seriously. Control of personal information is well placed with the national registration authorities. Europol is a form of intergovernmental cooperation and, fortunately, the Amsterdam Treaty excludes any proposal to make police cooperation supranational.</p>

I only know that this has been very difficult to achieve, especially when we only have ‘soft' rights to exercise control. I have often been extremely irritated by the fact that we look at recommendations which have been dealt with by a Council working group, but it turns out that our first chance to discover what they really mean comes at the implementation stage. I feel that the same issues will come up again in relation to telephone tapping. In this respect, the Council's attitude is very important; our rights should be respected, and we should be given enough time to be able to have our say.</p>
<p class="contents">One such recommendation, which is now on the point of being implemented, concerns reversing the burden of proof in respect of the seizure of property that has been criminally appropriated. I am concerned that the rules which apply here are rather ‘soft' and can be used in a way that infringes people's rights. Even in my own country, Finland, the recommendation is in the process of being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bontempi, the rapporteur, would also like us to explore the possibility of having a European ‘Charter' on human rights, to be drawn up by the Union. The German Presidency has also mentioned such a possibility. I would say to you: let us investigate this by all means, but we should proceed with caution. I do not believe we need any new instruments, but instead should implement those we have more effectively. I should like to see the European Social Charter become part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , as well as the existence of effective mechanisms for following up on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, like everyone else here, I hope that the extraordinary summit in Tampere in Finland is a success and that we come up with concrete decisions. We do not need lengthy action programmes, but we do need concrete and balanced measures that will be of benefit to ordinary decent people.</p>

This is a good thing, but the problem is that the Member States have not up till now had a clear enough vision of how cooperation under the third pillar might be more effectively developed. For example, there is an inexcusably wide difference in standards among the Member States when it comes to surveillance of the Union"s external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems that are rife in the single market, such as drug trafficking, the growing availability of illegal drugs and trafficking in human beings, and the contributory cause of all such problems, which is the less than perfect way surveillance is carried out on the Union"s external borders, all call for Europol to play an even greater role in the future than is provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Europol cannot be allowed to remain just a bureaucratic central agency.</p>
<p class="contents">If cooperation between the police and the customs authorities cannot be made closer, the future is hardly rosy for the single market, especially as the Union"s future enlargement to the east will in any case mean extra pressures and totally new challenges with regard to the surveillance of the Union"s external borders and our efforts to combat organised crime.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Mr President, tonight's debate has shown how much still remains to be done in the area of justice and home affairs. The new Treaty will soon enter into force, providing us with an ambitious goal to work towards, namely to preserve and at the same time to develop Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The combined concepts of freedom, security and justice provide a clear and simple indication of the direction for our future work. Cooperation should relate to the conditions governing people's everyday lives. At the same time, there is the difficulty that so many different spheres of activity are involved. Our goals therefore have to be tailor‐made to fit each individual area of cooperation. It is a delicate task which I hope will be one of the main topics for debate at the Tampere summit in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bontempi report makes an important contribution here. It serves to confirm that we have to become accustomed to thinking of Europe as a common judicial area. In particular, I welcome the fact that Mr Bontempi, in his report, has stressed the rights of the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Treaty brings advantages in a number of different areas. Schengen, for instance, becomes one of the Union's areas of cooperation, hopefully making the free movement of persons a complete reality at last for the people of Europe. Freedom within Europe cannot be reserved exclusively for European citizens. It must extend to absolutely everyone who lives in or lawfully visits our countries. This is an important message with potentially far‐reaching implications for all future cooperation. I hope that Parliament takes the same view.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, freedom implies more than just being able to move around freely. Freedom also means being entitled to live in a society where there is effective intervention against those who consider themselves to be above the law. The European idea therefore continues to be that all the Member States should have confidence in each other's ability to deal effectively with serious organised crime, for example. That is largely what Europol is about. Its mandate is a broad one, and we have created the long‐awaited instruments for combating organised crime. Mr Nassauer, in his report, points out that Europol's operational powers need to be extended, and quickly. I agree that in the long term, Europol should be given powers that would make collaboration between police and customs authorities in the Member States as effective as possible. The Amsterdam Treaty offers precisely this possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Hitherto, it has been a question of Europol exploiting its current mandate to the full. The organisation's credibility depends to a large extent on the added value which the police and customs authorities in the Member States see in their cooperation activities. The benefit derived from Europol stands in direct proportion to the number of crimes solved, in which context it can be said that the support provided by Europol has taken the work forward. Another issue concerns how the organisation is to be supervised in the future, and in this respect the different Member States have different experiences. When a new Treaty comes to be drawn up, this aspect should without doubt be one of the main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about fighting crime, we are also talking about judicial cooperation. When the work of the police and customs has been completed, it is time for the prosecution services, the lawyers and the courts to play their part and the differences in criminal law in the various Member States then become relevant. What is regarded as a criminal offence in one country is not necessarily regarded as such in another. For instance, there are variations in what constitutes organised crime, or in the definition of a child in terms of sexual exploitation. Moreover, there is not enough cooperation between the courts. Among numerous examples, fraud is an important area in which the situation has been exploited by those engaged in organised crime. I therefore agree with Mr Wiebenga that we must find a solution to the problem. Quite simply, we have to plug all the loopholes that exist. In my view, we should first of all try to agree on the types of crime that should be regarded as the most serious in all the Member States. Corruption, trafficking in persons, drugs smuggling, rape, the sexual exploitation of children and terrorism are examples of crimes which should carry uniformly harsh penalties. In this respect, the Amsterdam Treaty provides a chance to agree at least on a set of minimum rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that these rules operate in an internationally organised judicial environment. It is a question of ensuring that our judicial authorities work effectively together, in spite of the differences that exist. This would make legal systems more genuinely accessible to people, irrespective of which Member State they happen to be in.</p>
<p class="contents">The Wiebenga report on criminal procedures (Corpus Juris) puts forward a model that would enable the different judicial systems within the European Union to work together more effectively. Central to the report is the protection of the Community"s financial interests. The report proposes, amongst other things, a far‐reaching harmonisation of criminal law in this area. It also contains a proposal for the establishment of a European public prosecutor to deal with crimes affecting Community financial interests. The Corpus Juris model is certainly ambitious, and many would say unrealistic. For my part, however, I think it is too early to dismiss Corpus Juris. Instead, we should await the results of the follow‐up study. I agree with the rapporteur that in any event there is good reason to strengthen cooperation between the prosecution services and examining magistrates within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few months, we have been shocked by the number of instances of child pornography on the Internet. Boys as well as girls have been subject to exploitation of the most heinous kind. Our concern for these children should lead us to take forceful action against such crimes. It is also, however, a question of cleaning up the Internet. We must as far as possible rid this unique communication and information network of all child pornography. The Schmid report describes the difficulties involved. It is not enough simply to increase resources and step up police cooperation. There also has to be cooperation at a deeper level between the authorities and the information services industry. What is required is the rapid dissemination of experiences and technical knowledge to enable the child porn homepages to be filtered out.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint action put forward in the autumn of 1998 deals precisely with improving this type of cooperation, and stresses in particular the importance of working with the industry and the public authorities. Furthermore, the Member States agree to review what special requirements the Internet service providers should be obliged to meet. We should also be seeking to ensure that Community programmes such as STOP and the action plan on Internet abuse are properly used to increase cooperation as part of our common efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Schmid when he says we could go further. In the first place, I think that trading in child pornography should be made a criminal offence in all the Member States and that there should be a Union‐wide age definition of a ‘child', although I am aware that this is easier said than done. At the same time, I also know that there is a sense of justice throughout Europe which demands vigorous action to end all aspects of child exploitation. The present climate should be highly conducive to moving the boundaries here.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a word about the d"Ancona report and the battle against drugs. The Union's current action plan on drugs comes to an end this year. The European Council has therefore asked the Commission to prepare a new action plan. The work was begun during the winter and is now more or less complete. In spite of the present circumstances, I hope to be able to bring forward the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, Mrs d'Ancona places particular emphasis on the importance of preventive measures. The same aspect is also one of the main themes of the Commission's proposal. It is also wholly in keeping with the guidelines approved during the UN's special session on drugs last summer. We also attach considerable importance to what we call an integrated and global strategy. Isolated efforts are not enough, no matter how well executed they are. Everything that is done in this area must hang together and form a coherent whole. For instance, the ground must be prepared by preliminary work so that legal action can be taken against drugs‐related crime and drug abuse. A repressive approach should always be accompanied by a strong social commitment. It is therefore clear that measures adopted at national level should take account of the possible effects which they may have on the global community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Drugs‐related issues have become a priority. People also expect clear signals from the Union as to how we plan to meet the challenges that lie ahead of us. It is therefore vital that there should be a wholehearted commitment on the part of Europe and all its institutions. I know that Mrs d'Ancona is also satisfied with the interinstitutional cooperation which has been established during the past year between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in the battle against drugs. In her report, she also highlights the need for effective cooperation, as well as coordinated measures. I am wholly in agreement, and I sincerely hope that the cooperation which we have succeeded in establishing will be further developed during the coming years.</p>
