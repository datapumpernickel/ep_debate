It is a community of values, and it is precisely in difficult times that it must prove itself to be a strong community of values in all policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and its Member States are based on the common principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. An indispensable element of the rule of law in the context of criminal proceedings is the presumption of innocence, supported by clear and comprehensive procedural rights for the accused persons. Following the directive on the right to interpretation and to translation, the new directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings is a further important cornerstone in ensuring that suspected and accused persons are given a fair trial across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of equal standards for procedural rights in criminal matters will strengthen our citizens’ trust in the judicial systems of the Member States. The mutual recognition of court decisions will also encourage this. An individual can only comprehensively exercise his procedural rights if he knows what those rights are. For a fair trial, it is crucial that people are aware of their rights and that they know what the accusation against them is. If authorities fail to observe these procedural rights, then they jeopardise the fairness of the proceedings and risk miscarriages of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing EU legal framework in the judicial area focuses on improved cooperation between judicial authorities. In contrast, the new directive concentrates on our citizens and the rights they enjoy in criminal proceedings. It states that police officers and prosecutors must provide people who have been arrested with written information concerning their rights in simple terms in a language they can understand. In addition to the right to interpretation and translation, this includes in particular informing them of the accusation against them, of the right to legal assistance and of the right to be heard by a judge without delay following arrest. In addition, Parliament has been able to expand the specific rights of which the suspect is to be informed. We have succeeded in integrating into the directive the right of access to medical assistance, the right to communication with relatives and the right to remain silent.</p>
<p class="contents">No one knows in advance how long a suspected person will remain in pre-trial detention, for how long he will be deprived of his liberty. It is therefore important that he is informed of his rights at an early stage and is also given access to material evidence for and against him. The accused person must not become the object of the criminal proceedings, but rather must be able to play an active part in the proceedings. The Member States must now adopt and implement the directive as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to the services of Parliament and of the Commission – and I would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, whose perseverance and really outstanding cooperation have made this report possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now important that the Council and Commission bring the follow-up measures to this directive to a rapid conclusion jointly with the European Parliament, thereby creating uniform standards and fair trials throughout the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to praise the role of Mr Albrecht, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as the important role played by all the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Parliament in general because it has contributed to maintaining the level of ambition of the Commission’s proposal. One thing in particular which I believe is very important for our citizens, the letter of rights, has been maintained in the final text as well as the actual list of rights and the moment when the rights apply. I also welcome the fact that additional rights were added to the list of rights, notably the right to remain silent, which shows again that it is very good that Parliament has codecision possibilities because Parliament preserves the rights of the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">The measure on the right of information in criminal proceedings, as you know, is part of the Procedural Rights Roadmap and the implementation of this roadmap is one of my top priorities. The letter of rights and right to information is now the second measure adopted; with the right to interpretation and translation having already been adopted. So we are progressing quickly on this issue and I think that is good for the Europe of the citizens and of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In some Member States I am asked the question: why do you do this – are those rights not the usual rights that everybody has? Unfortunately it still happens in some Member States that someone can be brought to trial and not know that he has a right to a lawyer or to an interpreter. We have even heard of cases where people have been tried in court and did not know or did not understand what the accusation against them was. With this measure, accused persons will receive a Letter of Rights, in a language they understand, and will be guaranteed to receive adequate information about the charges they face. This is important in today’s Europe in which millions of people exercise their right to free movement and travel to other EU Member States, be it to work, for study or for retirement. They need to know, if they find themselves caught up in criminal proceedings, that their rights are protected and that Parliament has helped to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this measure will also play a vital part in promoting mutual trust between justice systems in the EU, which in turn is necessary to enhance judicial cooperation, because without trust this cooperation cannot function.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, together with those instruments of mutual recognition, we are creating a continent of justice, rights and security for European citizens, and I thank the parliamentarians who make this possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am thus very interested about which rights we, as European citizens, will be able to exercise in future.

I consider this to be extremely important. I would once again call on the Member States to give up their resistance to certain provisions and to take the common path towards creating these standards.

The provision of information on rights is the basis for access to all rights. In order to prepare a defence, a person must know the details of the case in which he is being charged and of any available evidence. Suspected or accused persons do not always receive this information. Legislation and judicial practice differ considerably from one Member State to another. If suspects are not properly informed, the criminal proceedings may be unfair, which can give rise to unnecessary costs relating to delays in proceedings and to exercising appeal procedures and failed criminal investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no rules at a high enough level, and those rules which do exist are not enforced properly. No minimum standards are established in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and neither the Convention nor its enforcement mechanisms offer sufficient protection in all cases with regard to the provision of adequate information about rights and, in particular, about the charges. The manner in which these rights are reflected in Member States’ national practice varies. This reinforces the need for action at EU level. The Union’s instruments facilitating judicial cooperation between Member States are based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments, and this semi-automatic recognition requires mutual trust between judges and courts.</p>
<p class="contents">The available data shows that the problem of insufficient information is very serious and is not limited to particular Member States. Therefore, by adopting this Directive, we are taking another particularly important step towards better protection of basic rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I wish to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for their excellent collaboration on this dossier, as well as the Commissioner for the commitment she has shown in adopting rules which improve the procedural rights of defendants in criminal trials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These include, for example, the right to have access to a lawyer, the right to interpretation and translation, the right to be informed of the charge, the right to a regular review of detention and the right to be brought before a court. The proposal currently before the Committee seeks to improve the rights of suspected or accused persons, especially as regards information about rights and about the charge. It also covers the situation when a person is arrested under a European Arrest Warrant for prosecution or execution of a sentence. Having common minimum standards in relation to these rights should facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition, thereby improving the functioning of judicial cooperation between Member States. I agree with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which opted for a fragmentary approach in the plan to strengthen procedural rights. The right to information was presented as the second measure of the plan, which contains half of a Letter of Rights, partly excluding other rights. These concern legal advice and legal aid, communication with relatives, employers and consular bodies, and the rights of vulnerable suspects or accused persons.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the right to information should be supplemented with these other rights. I would like to thank you very much for your attention, Commissioner, and I hope you will take these proposals of ours into account in your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that a person who is arrested or questioned is in a vulnerable position and deserves to know their rights and how to apply them, but the quality of information provided is often poor. People often do not understand what rights they have, and this ignorance is exacerbated by being a foreigner and not speaking the local language. A particular need, given that we know that there is discrimination in granting of bail, is to know how to contest pre-trial detention.</p>
<p class="contents">EU laws are needed, backed by enforcement powers, to make concrete the rights theoretically available under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament rightly fought for information to be provided as soon as possible, as soon as someone is informed they are a suspect. No one should be left for hours in a police cell to stew without knowing what is happening to them or being able to contact a lawyer or consular help.</p>
<p class="contents">We also rightly insisted on the accused person or their lawyer having access to all material possessed by police or prosecutors that will be used as evidence, and at an early enough stage for a proper defence to be mounted.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Vice-President Reding, I believe MEPs’ success in inserting a right to silence is very important. I am glad that my own country, the UK, has opted into this measure, whatever else it is doing elsewhere, as it did with the first one on the procedural rights road map on the right to interpretation and translation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am hopeful that the UK will also take part in the third measure on access to legal assistance and advice. The UK has a good record in the field of defence rights, so in this area my country needs to be fully engaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we are many years overdue in matching the strengthened cross-border powers of prosecutors with stronger rights for accused persons. I hope that we have put one more brick in the foundations of fair trials across the EU so that miscarriages of justice over measures like the European Arrest Warrants will become a thing of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A fair trial means that the right of defence must be respected, and the right of defence can only be asserted if persons exercising it have full information about the rights to which they are entitled in the first place. It is hard for someone who is arrested to defend themselves, and it is even harder when they are arrested in a country other than their own. The provision of full information should therefore be of particular concern to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I approve of all of the solutions in the directive, but my only concern is whether its implementation will in fact work well in every instance, as we are dealing here with a difficult and delicate matter – the independence of the judiciary.

<p class="contents">Some Member States provide for accused persons to receive only oral information about their procedural rights, while others provide information – especially if it is technical – only in writing or at the request of the accused. Since over 8 million criminal proceedings are brought in the European Union every year, it is easy to see that an information system that is still so varied and heterogeneous is inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree with the content and aims of this directive.

<p class="contents">With regard to the stage after proceedings have begun, I agree with the two specific rights selected: the right of accused people to full information about the charges brought against them, and their right to access to the case file. These are two essential conditions for determining and challenging the lawfulness of the arrest or detention and for enabling them to put up the best possible defence.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs on their work during the informal trialogues.

<p class="contents">Denial of procedural rights can have a very detrimental effect on the fairness of the criminal process and may lead to judicial errors.

The proposal will successfully lay down common minimum standards for the right to information in criminal proceedings within the European Union. I thought at the outset that the proposal tabled by the Commission was very good. I would therefore like to offer my particular congratulations to Commissioner Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process I was particularly concerned that the rights of the suspected person – particularly as regards the right to remain silent – should have no negative consequences, as was in fact the case in the law of certain Member States. That is now ensured. I am pleased about that, too. In the course of the discussions on this report it became clear that in many Member States there is no legal obligation to inform a suspected person of his right to legal assistance, and moreover that in only ten Member States were suspected persons informed of their rights in writing, and that in three Member States there was even no possibility whatsoever of access to documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at France and the practice there as regards <span class="italic">garde à vue</span> – in which there is no access to a lawyer during the initial detention period – it is clear that we need to carry out some approximation at a European level, and that we need to do so in the near future. Only then will we be able to restore trust in other Member States’ judicial systems and ensure that mutual recognition of judgements can take place on such a basis. Unless we have achieved an adequate level of approximation we will not be able to forge ahead with measures such as the European Investigation Order.</p>
<p class="contents">This report takes us a big step in the right direction. I congratulate all those involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly, a country demonstrates how civilised it is by the way it treats suspects. For that reason, we consider that the specific proposal we are debating here today is very significant. I would like to thank Birgit Sippel for her efforts in introducing some elements into this proposal for a Directive, which are substantial for the suspect, for the letter of rights, that is, to know what the suspect is accused of and to establish, therefore, the right to remain silent and the right to learn of the substantial elements of which they are accused, as well as, of course, medical care, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I really want to highlight in this speech is the birth of this right, because this was the debate on the right to interpretation and translation, and this will be the debate on legal assistance for a suspect. When does this right come into being? When the suspected person is accused of something, and it is very important that this right is respected and that this right comes into force at the same time that the person becomes aware that they are a suspect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This new directive deals with a real issue faced by Romanian and European citizens, who, while enjoying freedom of movement within the European Union, must comply with the rules of 27 judicial systems. Greater harmonisation is needed between Member States’ judicial systems, both civil and criminal, and the first step towards this is to establish common standards for informing defendants. Often, defendants do not know either the local language or their rights under the national laws of Member States, and this can lead to abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">A good example is that of the Roma citizens from Romania and Bulgaria expelled from France without knowing what they were being accused of or what their rights were. The right to interpretation and translation and the right to be informed of one’s rights and obligations are fundamental and should be mandatory minimum standards in all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this connection, we should welcome the work that this House has put into this document. We also welcome the fact that rules of this kind, which concern fundamental rights, are covered by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget an issue which has been ignored here, although it too deserves attention, namely the situation of victims, who are often in a similarly difficult situation and do not receive adequate information, even though they have fallen victim to crimes which are sometimes atrocious. Sometimes they fall victim to these crimes in countries they are visiting as tourists, where they are unable to move around and defend their rights and reasons because of the language barrier. We must not forget about them, and we must not create an imbalance between the rights of the victim and those of the offender. We should remember that victims often become victims of crimes again, in a phenomenon known to researchers as ‘repeat victimisation’. This is due to the callousness of the judicial system, which does not respect their right to information or their right to protection, even though these should be the priority. In some jurisdictions the offender, often having acted deliberately and in full awareness of his deeds within an organised group, has more rights than his victim. This House must be vocal in its appeals for the rights of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I am calling on you, Commissioner, and I would encourage you to get involved in measures to help victims, to help all those who right now are falling victim to serious crime and are later entirely ignored by the state apparatus, even in Europe. We are obliged to make changes, Commissioner. Let us do something about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with the general right of a participant to be informed about procedural rights, the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council therefore also defines two specific kinds of right. The right to information about the charge and the right to access to the case file mark a major step towards a situation where criminal proceedings operate in relation to the accused at least within the basic outlines of related rules in EU countries. Compliance with common minimum standards in relation to the right to information in criminal proceedings will also allow public bodies to avoid misconduct that might later undermine confidence, as well as the correctness and legality of criminal proceedings.

With eight million criminal trials taking place annually across Europe, the bureaucracy alone was unlikely to be able to keep up with increased mobility. However, the situation has improved considerably since the Commission became aware of the problem of EU citizens not being informed in another Member State of their basic fundamental rights in a language they can understand. In some countries the information is given only verbally; in others it is given in writing in such complex language – legalese you might call it – that unless you have a legal background you would hardly understand any of it, even in your own mother tongue. It is therefore to be welcomed if information on rights is now to be provided in the EU languages in written form and in accessible language – not just so as to save on interpreting costs, but also because this simple measure could help to prevent judicial errors, which is a good thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore hope – and I am very confident about this – that we will again get a good proposal from the Commission for the next measure, which is the right to a lawyer; that we will be able to improve on this even further and that, following our discussions with the Council, we will once again be able to achieve a very good directive. I wish the rapporteur, Ms Antonescu, all the best with this and I believe she can count on the support of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
