Mrs Fontaine accompanied him, which prolonged the essential trialogue that we held with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, by a few minutes. </p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is experiencing a serious economic, social and political crisis. Despite some infringements of human rights, which have been rightly condemned by the international community, the country has remained, in essence, under the rule of law. It has been able to do so largely because of the dynamism of civil society and of the independence of its judicial system. Over the last three years, a reversal in its external economic situation has weakened its economic fabric, which is structured but ageing. Shifts towards authoritarianism and lax management of the economy have continued to tarnish the country’s image, undermined the confidence of the community of sponsors and has encouraged the people to challenge the government.</p>
<p class="contents">This discontent was expressed in February’s referendum on the constitution, which was the first time that the Presidential party had lost an election since independence in 1980. Legislative elections were therefore a major issue for the ruling party. In order to hamper the success of the opposition, the ruling party risked heightening tensions by conducting a tough election campaign and by making the unequal distribution of farmland the issue for mobilising the rural world and veterans of the war of independence. With regard to this issue, the Head of State has allowed a huge movement for the occupation of properties to develop and has halted the legal framework for future compulsory purchases. These shifts, which I have just mentioned, have resulted in the deaths of 33 people, they have made the economic crisis worse and have distorted fair competition in the elections, thereby creating a real risk of instability in southern Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union nevertheless considered it important that elections should be held and that the results should be credible and acceptable. It therefore sought the agreement of the Zimbabwean authorities to send, as far in advance of the elections as possible, a large mission of nearly 200 observers, thereby demonstrating the Union’s interest in seeing democracy consolidated in that country. Nobody can deny the fact that this presence contributed to reducing tensions and to restoring a climate, which was as conducive as possible, in such a highly sensitive context, to the free expression of the whole population’s right to vote. </p>
<p class="contents">I wish at this point to pay tribute to Mr Schori, who led this mission, and to the remarkable work accomplished by his team. Although our observers noted that the degree of violence, irregularities and intimidation in the period leading up to the elections meant that the words ‘free and honest’ could not be applied to the fifth legislative elections in the history of Zimbabwe, they nevertheless emphasised the efficient organisation of the voting itself, the large turnout – I believe it was the largest since independence was achieved – and the peaceful atmosphere in which it took place. The vote-counting processes were not cause for controversy either.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the European Union, I should also like to congratulate the Zimbabwean people, who, by taking part in these elections in such numbers, have proved their determination to take their destiny into their hands in a peaceful and democratic way. I am also pleased to note that the results of the elections have been universally accepted by all participating parties. The entry into Parliament of a significant opposition – in fact it almost has a majority in the seats that were contested in these elections – suggests that constructive debates will be held. Zimbabwe has undoubtedly turned a new page in its young history. </p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental problems still remain, of course, and they remain intact. This is why the Union is urging all political forces in Zimbabwe to mobilise and to bring together the threads of dialogue, in order to set the country firmly on the road to recovery. The Union hopes that the new government will adopt, with the help of the country’s new representatives, credible measures for getting the economy back on its feet, measures which are likely to restore the confidence of local operators and of donors. </p>
<p class="contents">For twenty years, the European Union has shown itself to be Zimbabwe’s leading partner in its development. Zimbabwe is a friendly country and a partner country under the Lomé Convention and the European Union hopes to continue this policy, with acknowledged respect for human rights, for democratic principles and for the primacy of law. Because the Union wishes to continue to intervene on behalf of those who have been worst affected by the crisis, it is particularly willing to provide assistance for the necessary land reform in order to reduce poverty, despite the fact that this has not been implemented in an orderly, transparent or rational way. The European Union wants to believe in the future of a democratic and prosperous Zimbabwe, which is a factor for the stability and the harmonious development of southern Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first of all may I say that I would have been delighted on this occasion to have spoken after Mr Schori who has obviously done an outstanding job – as the presidency said – in Zimbabwe. I think all of us who wish Zimbabwe well would want to congratulate him and all those who were in the EU observation team. They have all done a magnificent job. They clearly managed to fulfill their objectives under very difficult circumstances and they discharged their mandate in an extremely effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">The mobilisation of a full and experienced team on the ground less than four weeks after an informal decision by European Union foreign ministers is a tribute to the enormous efforts of everyone concerned. This and the professionalism of the observation mission enabled them to surmount numerous political hurdles. It made the operation a reference point for electoral observation in countries in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is widely acknowledged that the European Union mission contributed to reducing the levels of violence, and I think it is also recognised that it helped to build up the confidence of civil society during the elections. Once again may I stress that the reputation of Mr Schori and the role that he played were key factors in our judgment for the success of the mission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the mission constituted the most credible observer voice during these critical times in Zimbabwe. This was reflected in extensive press coverage during the whole period, both locally and internationally. What is more the European Union mission being by far the largest observer mission deployed in the country and operational right across the nation, also contributed significantly to the coordination of the overall electoral monitoring effort in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have of course had a chance of becoming acquainted with the main outlines of the report, though we are looking forward to the opportunity of studying it in detail. I know that the first part of the report follows the interim report which the honourable Member made, and is an account of the violence and intimidation which sadly marked the early stages of the election campaign. We know from what he has said that the report analyses the voting process and the conduct of the poll and I think – though I would not want to take words out of his mouth – that by and large the actual conduct of the poll seems to have been pretty satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and most importantly, and this is what we are looking forward to hearing from the honourable Member, the report focuses on the consequences for Zimbabwe's future. The honourable gentlemen is right to recommend that the European Union should in the coming weeks and months monitor very carefully what is happening in Zimbabwe and provide assistance and support wherever it is appropriate for us to do so. We would certainly want to endorse this, and my colleague Commissioner Nielson and I will certainly intensify our efforts to strengthen channels of communication, both formal and informal, with President Mugabe and his government, to facilitate the transition to effective multi-party democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member has spoken of how important it is that the government should prosecute those who have been involved in political violence or guilty of other human rights abuses; he has also stressed the importance of the courts determining the outcome of any challenge to the election results. It is very important that the government should respect their decisions. These are both enormously important points and touch, of course, centrally on the credibility of the whole democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is plainly at a crossroads. The outcome of the legislative elections could mark a major transformation in the country's political culture, the transition to a multiparty system in which Parliament will replace the ruling party Zanu PF politburo as the main policy-making institution. President Mugabe's electoral strategy, focused on land reform and support for the war veterans, failed to address the country's economic plight and this was obviously reflected in the votes polled by his party.</p>
<p class="contents">The new government of Zimbabwe and all those who want to see the country rise above its present serious difficulties, whether they relate to the economic situation, the question of land reform or the terrible scourge of HIV, must now address the challenges effectively, collectively and constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">We have considerable influence as a major donor. This influence has to be used to encourage the government to take positive steps for re-establishing the rule of law and good governance as a first step towards a more general recovery, and I know this is a point which my colleague, Commissioner Nielson will want to speak about after me. But, once again, I would like to offer my personal congratulations to the honourable Member on a very difficult job, extremely well done.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have managed to do excellent work under very difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of these elections offers the EU a new opportunity for reviewing our cooperation with Zimbabwe. According to the report by the heads of mission there is scope for positive development in Zimbabwe in the political, economic and social fields. Options for the EU to assist in such development should not be excluded, as they say.</p>
<p class="contents">Zanu-PF will have to develop new and more appropriate policies in order to approach the international community for finance to stabilise the economy and restore growth, but the legitimacy of Zanu-PF is at stake because of the extent to which intimidation and electoral malpractice helped it gain victory and because, even discounting the impact of such factors, the MDC won 58 seats, almost as many as Zanu, with 61+1. The Movement for Democratic Change will not want to share responsibility for the crisis the country is undergoing or for the painful measures which will be necessary for economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe's EUR 110 million 8th EDF national indicative programme has a direct poverty alleviation orientation. Its main sectors of cooperation are agriculture, health and education. The Commission's approach so far has been that aid directed to the protection of basic social services and the reinforcement of civil society should be maintained even during periods of crisis. A total of EUR 19 million is about to be released for a micro-projects programme which in the interests of consensual policies has been delayed until after the elections. It can thus now go ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has maintained its support for land reform through this micro-projects programme, which is actually for poverty alleviation assistance for legally acquired land in resettlement schemes. However, in April the Commission froze the EUR 2 million for technical and policy support for land reform. Until the government's land reform policy was clarified, there seemed little point in continuing a technical and quite academic discussion on the principles of land reform. Hopefully this will change.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and other donors are ready to support the process, provided it is in the framework of legality, transparency and poverty alleviation objectives, in accordance with the 1998 donor land conference agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is preparing a cross-sectoral programme to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Zimbabwe, which is in itself a development crisis and a major cause of present and future poverty. This programme is to be financed from the EUR 33 million in the 8th EDF second tranche. I will take a decision on this in the next few months depending on developments in Zimbabwe. In any event the European Commission is continuing to support poverty alleviation schemes. If the government seizes the opportunity offered by these new elections, EU support could be more substantial in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As noted by the heads of mission in Harare, it is premature to jump to conclusions on the election and its consequences. I fully share the view that EU-Zimbabwe development cooperation will depend on real progress in the fields of democratisation, rule of law, human rights and economic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to stress that there is potential for increased cooperation with Zimbabwe, but this will clearly depend on how the situation develops there.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schori (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President and Commissioners, I am speaking English not out of distaste for two languages that I like very much – French and Swedish – but because it was the working language of the mission. Thank you very much for your kind words.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my pleasure to give the first presentation of the final report of the EU Election Observation Mission to Zimbabwe here in the European Parliament, an institution that has taught me so much and been such a joy to work in.</p>
<p class="contents">“These were not perfect elections,” said the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai drily. Indeed, in the view of our 190 election observers with experience of seven observation missions as an average, the pre-election period was one of the worst they had ever been in, while the actual election days, the polling, voting and count were among the best they had been.</p>
<p class="contents">What should one make out of such a schizophrenic picture, where, on one hand politically-motivated violence and intimidation cost more than 30 people their lives, with many more being threatened, persecuted, injured, raped and tortured, and, on the other, where the voters turned out nevertheless in record numbers, giving the opposition party almost half of the votes? All along in our mission I refused to use the term "free and fair elections", because it is not applicable. It is too blunt an instrument, in such a complex process as the one we witnessed in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our mission had, therefore from the beginning stressed that we were not only there for the election process, but that our final report would also attach great attention to the post-election phase. In this phase, the role and responsibility of President Mugabe, whose mandate lasts another two years, is crucial. I underlined this in a conversation with him as well as in my public statements in Zimbabwe, saying that after revolution comes nation-building, after elections reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our hope was that, in spite of the extensive violence and intimidation campaign for which the ruling Zanu-PF had by far the greatest responsibility, the people, aided by a large international and national monitoring presence, could cast their votes in a relatively free, fair and non-violent environment on election day. Thereby the period after the elections would be essential, and so would the role of the president and the Zanu leaders, and they would hopefully contribute to a climate of reconciliation and calm.</p>
<p class="contents">To a certain extent our strategy proved to be right. People did vote in great numbers. Violence and intimidation did not seem to scare them off from the polling stations. Many also openly showed their sympathies for the opposition parties. It is not that we were partisan, we had our code of conduct of professionalism and strict neutrality, but we did want the people to feel that their vote was secret, that on election day the President and the peasant are equal, and that democratic elections are the power of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">There was much violence and terror in the run-up to the elections and we condemn it. But I would also like to stress that there was much more non-violence in the form of the millions of people who wanted to exercise the democratic right to vote. The main opposition party, while challenging the results in 20 constituencies, has also accepted the results of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the people of Zimbabwe, who cry out for peace and law and order, progress and a decent life, deserve a better deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to summarise our conclusions and recommendations in four points:</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative that the government moves swiftly to re-establish the rule of law and to allow the police and prosecution services to act against those who have been involved in or encouraged political violence or other human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">A new independent election organisation above partisan interest, and with sufficient human and financial resources to operate effectively is needed. The government must also allow the courts to determine the outcome of any challenge to election results in particular constituencies, and must respect their decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should endeavour to ensure that international observers are deployed in good time for the presidential election scheduled to take place in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should make a particular effort during the coming weeks and months to monitor events in Zimbabwe closely and provide assistance and support where appropriate. I am glad to hear that both the presidency and the Commission also take this line.</p>
<p class="contents">For that purpose, our central election unit in Harare will remain for some time, as well as 25 EU observers deployed through the country. Add to that our 14 heads of mission who will be on red alert. Let me use this opportunity to pay tribute to the Election Unit, to the EU observers including friends from Norway and Kenya who were integrated into our mission, as well as five Members of the European Parliament. The Commission, of course, responded in a swift and commendable way to the decision of the Council, and the continuous cooperation and dialogue throughout the process has been invaluable.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by saying that the EU mission was a high-profile one, very well received among the people in general to a point that would be the envy of several Member States, including mine, Mr Patten. The mission can also be seen as an efficient conflict-prevention exercise. It was quickly on the spot, in great numbers spreading calm and peace; it was operational in no time, with a good national coverage and with a sustainable strategy also for the post-conflict phase.</p>
<p class="contents">Our mission was an act of commitment to the people in Africa and to democracy worldwide. I see the mission to Zimbabwe as a natural consequence of our support for the struggle for African independence and of our wish to build a strong partnership with a peaceful and democratic Zimbabwe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gahler (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since February Zimbabwe’s political landscape has been characterised by the illegal occupation of farms, flouting of court judgements, intimidation and violence towards opposition parties, their candidates and supporters, and at least an attempt at restricting the work of national and international election observers. We also know who bears the main responsibility for these acts of violence: it is the leadership of the ruling party Zanu-PF.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I will be more specific. It is President Mugabe who has authorised the occupation of farms, frustrated efforts to enforce court judgements, and defended the lack of respect for law and order, sometimes against the advice of his own Ministers. It is clear to me that this insight exposes a dilemma, namely that the person who is the main cause of the problem must also take responsibility, at least for a certain amount of time, for part of the solution to the problem, particularly in view of the need for national reconciliation. Because the things we experienced and heard reports of at first hand, were shattering. Not only did we hear that in some parts of the country, opposition candidates were unable to enter their constituency for fear of risking life and limb, we also learnt that large sections of the rural population were being systematically terrorised in villages or on commercial farms.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the government used its monopoly of TV and radio shamelessly to convey its own view of things. The opposition press only reached the urban population. Elections that take place under such conditions cannot be described as free and fair. All the more reason why I should regret the fact that several African observers evidently reached the opposite conclusion. In so doing, they did democracy, but above all, the people of Africa, a disservice. All those who have campaigned for their democratic rights, despite the adverse circumstances, deserve respect and recognition, particularly the national observers and the many thousands of electoral assistants who managed the practicalities of the election process with great fastidiousness and commitment.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make particular mention of the professional manner in which Pierre Schori led our committed team acting on behalf of the Council, i.e. the EU observer mission. Unerringly, and following precise analysis, he reached a verdict that we as EP observers wholeheartedly embrace. The presence of the EU observers clearly reduced the scale of violence and intimidation. I would like to express my deepest thanks and appreciation. Pierre Schori and his team have rendered outstanding service to democracy in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Now the elections have taken place we want to see some changes. Tension is obviously rising in the rural areas, partly because the President has failed to issue a statement clarifying matters, and this situation gives cause for concern. More farms have been occupied since the elections. There are reports on individual acts of violence towards opposition sympathisers. The Archbishop of Bulawayo has received death threats. We demand the punishment of all those guilty of criminal acts against their fellow citizens, an end to lawlessness when the necessary land reform is being carried out, and respect for court judgements on the occupation of farms. The aim of land reform must be to benefit those who are truly needy. It is still important for us to engage in dialogue with the government, the opposition and the socially relevant forces, so that in future, Zimbabwe is able to make a contribution towards stability in southern Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They were a defeat in the sense that, for the first time in its short independent life, Zimbabwe has a multi-party political system, which was something that Mugabe clearly opposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from tolerating, and even, as we know, promoting, a climate of intimidation and violence, Mugabe has made considerable errors of judgement. On the one hand, he has underestimated the European Union’s seriousness, willingness and capacity to act in the case of Zimbabwe. However, he has also confused the factors within his own country. I wonder if this is due to the arrogance of a former, although once respected, African freedom fighter, or to his ignorance of the sociological and political evolution of his country. It is probably a combination of both things.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe has brought to these elections the customs and methods of a war of liberation, on occasion treating political rivals as if they were colonial occupiers who needed to be banished. However, he was unable to appreciate that the emergence of the middle classes was an element which was going to have a different effect for the first time on these elections.</p>
<p class="contents">This relative consolidation of a new urban vote, together with the manipulation of official democracy and the violation of human rights, would not otherwise have led to many citizens voting against him, and that is what they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">The country and the population will gain as a whole if the current government and the emerging opposition show sufficient political wisdom and common sense to generously and cautiously deal with the transition from former political customs to other new ones. In this area, the opposition also has a role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, after all the accusations and condemnations, in the coming weeks we must watch carefully for any signs of verifiable reconciliation and self-critical acceptance of the errors made.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this will help the future of Zimbabwe, its society and the new political culture born of these elections. We must give decisive support to its future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I pay great tribute to him.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt in Zimbabwe that it has been a case of "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely". Mr Mugabe has much to answer for. If the result may be said to have a positive side, it is the fact that there is now no longer absolute power.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the violence that took place before the elections can be based directly back to the leadership of Zanu-PF and to President Mugabe himself. The so-called war veterans – they must have been very young when the war of independence was on – have been paid to be on these farms. This is a grave problem which be traced directly back to the leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">There were problems too with the fact that the postal votes, which were sent directly to the army in the Congo on Thursday, miraculously returned on Saturday, all in due form going into many marginal constituencies. Threats of violence against supporters of the MDC have continued after the elections. The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened. All these things must be stopped. We cannot possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that President Mugabe wants to stifle inward investment by nationalising the farms, and threatening to do the same with the mines, will do nothing to resolve the economic situation in Zimbabwe. What Zimbabwe needs is much more inward investment from outside the country. This will not take place under the present regime.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great and wonderful opportunity in Zimbabwe now with the emergence of the MDC, for all races to work together. There is great hope for the future, but we must make sure that we keep up the pressure on Zimbabwe and especially on Mr Mugabe. We should take direct action against assets that President Mugabe owns outside of Zimbabwe. We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is probably one of the things we should give the Mugabe government credit for during its early years. The population is knowledgeable despite the fact that the opposition was prevented from taking part in the election propaganda in a normal way, at least as far as the official media is concerned. I know Zimbabwe quite well. For quite a few years running, I visited the country and followed the situation from close by, but I was surprised at the extent of intimidation prior to the elections and I fear that this may continue, even after the elections. Accordingly, I think we should act within the remit of our international responsibility and ensure that we continue to exert the same benevolent influence after the elections that we had in the run-up to them. We can do this by driving a hard bargain, yet remaining specific, regarding the planned reforms in Zimbabwe. A reign of terror pervades the countryside, and this cannot be allowed to continue, of course, because this affects the quality of life of the white and black population alike. I would like to underline this because these people are also being sucked into a maelstrom of events which are beyond their control. </p>

I can only lend wholehearted support to what the previous speakers and Mrs Maij-Weggen have had to say. However I would like to add to the debt of gratitude we owe Mr Schori a word of thanks to the embassies of our Member States, who assisted us in the accreditation process, because we were faced with a rather chaotic situation at the time. We have them to thank for the fact that we were able to take action over there.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If there is one thing that should be emphasised when forming an assessment of the situation in Zimbabwe it is that the farm occupations have nothing to do with the land or race issues. It is no more than a despicable means of holding onto power. That is not without its tragic side because President Mugabe and his party definitely rendered outstanding service to the land once. The terror perpetrated by the so-called war veterans is intended to divert attention from the shortcomings of the political leadership of the country, which has pitched Zimbabwe into a deep crisis. The country has been brought to the brink of ruin, tourism is at a standstill, investors have pulled out, and to make matters worse, there is an oil crisis and a lack of foreign exchange. Tobacco production and tourism used to be the main sources of revenue and both these sectors have taken a real knock. This cannot be made good overnight. This is where support from the European Union comes in.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, Zimbabwe has the right conditions in place for this, in that the population is educated to a comparatively high standard, the jurisdiction is incorruptible, and the infrastructure is relatively sound. But we are already hearing about fresh occupations of farms and violent attacks. President Mugabe must be left in no doubt as to the fact that the violence and terror must be stopped, but it will take more than that to restore peace to this country. The political opposition will have to prove that it is politically viable. The fact that it was possible for observers to be present meant that in the end, despite the terror, the opposition was able to express its opinion freely on voting day. That being the case, the opposition now has a job to do which it must see through. We must help to see that the rule of law is restored in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everything spoke of a genuine desire on the part of the people of Zimbabwe to build a democratic civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of Zimbabwe compel us, however, to consider the relationship between democracy and values, and this may be the right forum for that, as we refer to the EU as a society of values. At the same time we openly admit that the EU cannot dash about the world paternally handing out advice to others from on high. It is a matter of dialogue. That was what Pierre Schori, as leader of the EU delegation of election observers, also demonstrated admirably.</p>
<p class="contents">Something happened in Zimbabwe that should make every politician consider how we can prevent the demoralising effects of power – among ourselves also. Why does a former hero of a nation, the father figure of a struggle for independence, now allow the use of violence simply to underpin his own authority? And what has happened to a person’s soul and sense of morality when he has the audacity to proclaim during the elections that the government will be staying in power, no matter what the result?</p>
<p class="contents">The philosopher and theologian, Niebuhr, once said that a person’s sense of what is right makes democracy possible, but his inclinations in the opposite direction make democracy absolutely necessary. In other words: a person’s virtue makes democracy possible; on the other hand, his vices make it necessary. I think this is one of the truest remarks ever made about democracy. It follows that, in order to flourish, democracy needs its internal structures to be looked at critically and, indeed, has to be prepared to submit to criticism. That means that we are willing, in the name of democracy, to encourage people to take a critical stand as citizens. On the other hand, it requires transparency in decision making and the flow of information. Only in this way can democracy preserve its self-remedying nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In Zimbabwe I also realised very clearly that we cannot speak of human rights without the recognition of human dignity. It is just empty talk unless it is committed to the unique value and integrity of the individual. At the same time, I would like to pay my respects to those thirty or more victims of violence who were to die whilst expressing their desire to struggle in favour of a free civil society.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report drawn up by the mission led by Mr Schori, the thoroughness of whose work I must emphasis once again, as did Commissioners Patten and Nielsen, provides us with a perfectly clear and impartial analysis of the way in which Zimbabwe’s legislative elections were held.</p>
<p class="contents">The electoral situation was particularly tense, not to say violent. I am convinced that the Union was right, profoundly right, to send this mission, a long time in advance, in order to bring an element of calm to this campaign. The benefit of this mission in this regard, as in many others, is undeniable. The mission must continue its work on the ground, as Mr Schori requested. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council Presidency is delighted at the generally smooth running of these elections, even if, here and there, the voting conditions might have left us rather perplexed and the mission’s conclusions on this matter are extremely enlightening. </p>
<p class="contents">It is now time to forge ahead in conjunction with Zimbabwe. The Council Presidency fully supports the Commission’s analysis of the need to cooperate with Zimbabwe. Numerous areas in which we can work have opened up, and they deserve our full involvement. Amongst these are the strengthening of democracy, poverty reduction, and the fight against Aids. It is crucial that European aid has a direct bearing on the economic and social problems that are besetting the people of Zimbabwe. Community funds must now be released, as Commissioner Nielsen suggested. </p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Government of Zimbabwe must also move forward and fulfil its commitments to land reform, to respect for court judgements and to economic transparency. I am convinced that this process needs to ensure the stabilisation of the country and also its democratic involvement in regional integration. This is why the Council Presidency, and you can be sure of this, ladies and gentlemen, will commit itself to achieving this aim with the same determination as the European Parliament and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
