When the memorial service of what was the worst disaster to befall my country over recent years is held in Salzburg Cathedral on Friday, I know that this Parliament will be among the mourners and I thank you for your words of sympathy and comfort for the relatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months' work and a long struggle for consensus, we now have a draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Today is the day we have to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to this Charter and your rapporteurs recommend that plenary adopt and vote in favour of this Charter of Fundamental Rights. This recommendation is born of a firm conviction. Like many of you, I too regret that we are only allowed to say yes or no and are unable to send the Council any other political message which might have been called for in this context in order to express the critical support of this House for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is but a first step and is still a far cry from what Parliament demanded of this political project in March of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must also remember here is what gives this Charter its value, assuming that it is adopted. I think that it grants one initial fundamental right, one unwritten fundamental right and that is people's right to know their rights. This fundamental right has now been granted. Vague formulations and legal principles have given way to a clear system of fundamental rights which is binding on all the EU institutions and whenever European law is applied by the Member States. The value of this Charter is that it has transformed rights vested in international law – vested but not binding, vested but not enforceable, vested but not guaranteed – into legal principles, nay into the constitutional principles of the Union itself, setting up a dynamic process which will surely end one day with a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What has revolutionised the debate and the history of fundamental and human rights is that, for the first time, social rights have been listed in this Charter on a par with traditional human rights and traditional principles; no Member State has ever done that in its list of fundamental rights. This Charter is also the expression of a common set of basic values for all the candidate countries, for all the countries wishing to join the European Union, and it is precisely in the area of social rights that it sends candidate countries a clear message that they must comply with these social standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It marks – and I am firmly convinced of this, even if many Heads of State and Government prefer not to admit it – the beginning of the constitutional process which this Parliament has called for so often and with such persistence. I am certain that, with this Charter of Fundamental Rights, we have laid the foundation stone for a future European constitution and constitutional process. I think that is reason enough for us to adopt this Charter, even though there are points at which it may be hard to accept that many rights, many basic rights which Parliament demanded for the people of Europe, and with good cause, have been left out of the Charter. It is hard to see why the right to a fair wage has been left out and why we came up against insurmountable resistance when it came to the right to a decent minimum standard of living, the right to work and the right to housing. This Charter will, I think, need to be supplemented in the future, if it is to become the foundation stone of a European constitution. But that should not deter us from taking this first decisive step.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, even though it can only say yes to this Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament will clearly apprise the Council of its demand for this Charter to be made legally binding over coming weeks, so that it can open the way to the European Court of Justice for the citizens of Europe. I hope that this House will emphasise these demands by a large majority in its resolution on Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I have to say. I should just like, if you will allow, firstly to thank my co-rapporteur for his committed approach and the vast amount of remarkable work which he carried out and secondly, to thank you for your support.</p>

We faced an extraordinarily complex task for the inscription of fundamental rights and freedoms found inside the constitutional traditions of Member States and also within the general principles of Union law.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion the convention managed to strike a sound balance between self-restraint and aspiration. We refrained from superseding the Treaties but maximised their impact by making the relationship between the citizen and the Union for the first time clear and visible. Some people will be disappointed that the Charter was unable to go further but it is of course a compromise forged in the crucible of the convention and it represents a balance between competing political tendencies, nationalities and cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">That balance commanded a broad consensus inside the convention and should do so too inside the European Parliament. Parliament played a strong part is formulating the Charter. We profited from participating strongly in the process and the citizens we represent will profit from its solemn proclamation especially as Article 52.3 says the Union can then proceed to grant more extensive protection of European fundamental rights as European integration proceeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to address the House as part of an in-depth debate on this fine project to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union before Parliament adopts its final position on this text. Admittedly, we have already exchanged views on this matter on two occasions, firstly on 3 October, following an oral question from the Chairman of your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Giorgio Napolitano, and then on 24 October, when I came to Parliament to present the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October, where, indeed, the Charter was one of the major items on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">For all that, however, today’s debate, in my opinion, is a far cry from being needless repetition. It is, on the contrary, particularly important as today Parliament is to decide if, as is urged by the conclusions of the Cologne Council, it is going to proclaim this text, jointly with the Council and the Commission, at the European Council meeting in Nice, which is less than a month away now. This is quite clearly a major political decision and a fresh opportunity to show the citizens of Europe the whole scope of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the position advocated by your Committee on Constitutional Affairs – and let me congratulate the Committee’s rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, who have just spoken – urges you to adopt the text of the Charter as it stands and, therefore, to mandate your President to proclaim the Charter on behalf of Parliament in Nice, alongside the Presidents of the Council and of the Commission. As you know, this position is in line with that adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Biarritz European Council who unanimously and unreservedly approved the Charter, and I can only urge you, therefore, on behalf of the Council, to follow suit, perhaps giving you a few reasons to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council Presidency sees this Charter as symbolising a twofold success. A success, in the first place, in terms of the method adopted: that of a body, the Convention, made up of Members of the European Parliament, national parliaments, the European Commission – and let me take this opportunity to greet Mr Vitorino, who brought all his competence to bear – and of personal representatives of the Heads of State and Government, the whole body subject to the enlightened chairmanship of Mr Roman Herzog, the former President of both the Karlsruhe Court and the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the diversity and the quality of the appointed Members represented an unquestionable asset. I find similarly extraordinary the twofold concern which the Convention had – to work with the utmost transparency and interaction with the public, particularly through the Internet. So, with a concern for openness which paid off in the end, in the course of its work the Convention heard from the major European non-governmental organisations, both sides of industry in Europe and, importantly, too, for the future, the candidate countries. This transparency and openness actively contributed to the gradual improvement of the various versions of the draft Charter and enabled the final version to be the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Convention experiment already clearly appears to be one of the avenues – one, but not the only avenue – which Europe could follow up in future in order to be more transparent and in touch with the opinions of European citizens. Members of the European Parliament, particularly in our previous debate, have already expressed the wish to repeat the experiment. I, personally, have no doubt that such an opportunity will present itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The second and main success, is the result which the Convention achieved. The Charter is primarily – and this is rare enough to be worthy of note, as I have seen particularly in the preparations for the IGC – a clear and well-organised document. Combining around fifty articles, which, in fact, makes for a short text, subdivided into six chapters with titles that ring true, and could perhaps be a new motto for Europe: dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens’ rights, justice, it unquestionably answers the requirements for concision and clarity and thus, also, the concerns and expectations of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the Charter is a perfectly consistent text. The authors of the text managed to fulfil a twofold requirement that was not easy to satisfy: firstly, to avoid creating law out of nothing and, secondly, to give us a precise snapshot of the scope of fundamental rights in force within the European Union, while also giving us a dynamic picture with potential for further development.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced, however, that the Charter will make its mark most especially by the strength of its content. Firstly, it precisely restates the fundamental rights laid down, in the main, in the European Convention on Human Rights. In this respect, the authors of the Charter were careful throughout, as was also stipulated in the specification, to avoid any risk of conflict between the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, responsible for ensuring compliance with the Convention, and that of the European Court of Justice, in particular by adopting the wording used by the Council of Europe Convention when this seemed sufficiently finalised. Similarly, in the general provisions, Article 52(3) stipulates that, insofar as the Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, “the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention.”</p>
<p class="contents">It is my sincere opinion that in so doing, the authors of the text have with great precision minimalised as far as possible the risk of having conflicting case law in the two courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg. Moreover, at a time when we have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I think we can safely leave it to the judges of both institutions to fuel and continue the dialogue they already maintain, which is undoubtedly adequate guarantee against any risk of the two-speed Europe of human rights that some people have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite obviously, the Charter does not confine itself to merely restating pre-existing rights, with a little updating. This would have been somewhat disappointing. It also enshrines many new rights which are not included in the Convention and which are necessitated by developments in our societies, be it in terms of technological development, the emergence of new dependencies, or even the increasing complexity of our state and administrative systems. It is particularly important that European citizens should know, for example, that the European Union prohibits all human cloning for reproductive purposes or that it guarantees its citizens protection of their personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of course pleased to see, finally, the importance the text attaches to economic and social rights. France argued forcefully for this section to be a substantial one, but it was also the will of many other Member States, the European Parliament and a good many Members of the national parliaments, which can only be gratifying to the Council Presidency. At stake were the Charter’s innovatory strength and driving force as well as consolidation of the European social model, which we value so highly.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I must stress the importance of including a chapter entitled “Solidarity”. Let me, once again, congratulate President Herzog in person, who, I believe, was behind this. This value, this solidarity, is indeed what best sums up the European social model, which is consubstantial with the construction of the European Community. This is the solidarity which the Charter guarantees through the right to free education, the right of workers to be informed and consulted, the right to collective bargaining and action, including the right to strike, even if it was not easy to get it included in the text, but also through the right to protection against unjustified dismissal, the right to social protection and the ban on children working.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also stress Article 23, which is particularly clear in stipulating equality between men and women, and stating that this must be ensured in all areas, and that the principle of equality shall not prevent the adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I should say that this text unquestionably marks the greatest collective advance in terms of affirming social rights, both because of the importance of the rights enshrined and also because these rights are included for the first time in the same text as civic and political rights, thereby officially signposting the indivisible nature of all fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, nonetheless, that it has been possible to make a number of criticisms regarding the content of the Charter. There are some, for example, who denounce the text as reflecting the political choices of those advocating a liberal Europe and criticise the obligation for consensus as the method adopted within the Convention for adopting the Charter. These are criticisms put forward in a recently launched appeal from some Members of Parliament, especially Members of the European Parliament, calling for the Charter to be revised. As to the method, let me remind you that the Convention itself determined its own rules of procedure, without any external pressure, and that the rule of consensus seemed to be a particularly constructive option in a body as diverse as the Convention. I am sure the Convention members that are to speak here will be able to confirm that. I feel that this decision has most certainly contributed towards producing a text which I believe to be well-balanced and ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Trade Union Confederation, for its part, saw fit to complain about what it considers to be some omissions, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum income, for example. I should therefore like to make a few things clear once again. The purpose of the Charter was to collate the fundamental rights, not, at this stage, to form a social treaty – regrettable as that may be, and it may be something that will come in time – and the Convention’s mandate, as stipulated in the initial specification, did not entitle it to create completely new social rights out of nothing. I am certain there will be further stages along this road.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Charter is not the only initiative launched by the French Presidency in the social field, quite the contrary. Indeed, the French Presidency has set the promotion of a more mutually supportive Europe at the top of its priorities. So, as you know, the Presidency, on the basis of the conclusions of the Lisbon Council, has launched the initiative of a social agenda, intended to determine what action the European Union will undertake in the next few years in order to take existing needs in to account, providing, in particular, a qualitative and quantitative improvement in employment, as well as greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that these two approaches, the Charter and the social agenda, complement each other and properly reflect our determination to place social matters at the heart of the construction of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, moreover, also like to point out some grounds for satisfaction for the Presidency, and I believe for other institutions too, in the overall position adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation, which stresses the connection between the Charter and the social agenda and which concludes that the Convention’s proposed Charter, adopted by the Heads of State and Government, “represents an important step towards the construction of a social and a citizens’ Europe”. I feel this is a significant statement – one that I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government were alive to this determination when they, if not adopted – that is still to come in Nice – at least approved the text of the Charter. The balance arrived at by the authors has met with general approval, and the Presidency has no desire to reopen the debate, no more than, I believe, your rapporteurs do.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now, in conclusion, turn to the matter of the legal status of the Charter, which has already been mentioned. I clearly heard your rapporteurs once again expressing the desire to see the Charter form the preamble to a constitutional treaty and you know that I, personally, am in favour of this, but I should like to point out, because we are bound to be extremely precise regarding what is happening today, that the European Council in Biarritz was forced to note that the majority of Member States were not willing to discuss the matter of incorporating this Charter into the Treaties, at least for the time being. I can assure you, then, since it will not be possible to pose this question officially until after Nice, that the French Presidency fully intends to strive to include this perspective in the conclusions of the Nice European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that several individuals, Members of the European Parliament in particular, have suggested that explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already refers to the European Convention on Human Rights. They have thus pointed out what is really a paradoxical situation, whereby the Treaty on European Union would not mention a new text actually belonging to the European Union even though it already refers to an existing text belonging to the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that, in a personal capacity, I have shown my openness to this proposal, and even my support for it, and I would reiterate that here. However, once again on the basis of its bilateral contacts, the Presidency is forced to acknowledge that several Member States do not wish to see this. I should, moreover, like to inform the European Parliament that, on the initiative of the Presidency, a debate was held yesterday within the Preparatory Group for this issue. They inform me that the discussion was not entirely conclusive, perhaps signifying that some of the governments might be inspired by a clear statement of views from the European Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced then, that this Charter, by virtue of its clarity, its coherence and its content, will come to the fore as the benchmark text which the European Union so badly needed. I can only, therefore, on behalf of the Council Presidency, urge you once again to adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights with a view to its joint official proclamation in Nice. I am convinced that this will be one of the highlights of this European Council bringing the French Presidency to an end.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the main tasks of the directly-elected members of the European Parliament, which represents the 370 million citizens of the European Union, is to bring the unifying structure of Europe closer to its people. That is why it was so important and why Parliament was right not only to invest so much hope in a new Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union but also to help so intensively and constructively to bring it about.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a huge feather in this institution's cap – as is the fact that the groups stood side by side here – that we managed to secure 16 places for European Parliament representatives at the fundamental rights convention. The result before us is proof positive of the fact that giving the European Parliament a say was the right move.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me at this point to offer my warmest thanks and acknowledgement to those who represented us at the convention under the leadership of our fellow member, Mr Méndez de Vigo. Ladies and gentlemen – and I mean everyone involved from the European Parliament – made a decisive contribution; as a result, the difficult instructions of the Cologne European Council were carried out successfully in a very short space of time and with the maximum possible attention. I should like on behalf of our group to offer express thanks not only to all the members of our group but, most of all, to Vice-President Ingo Friedrich, who coordinated our work. But our special thanks must go to all the members of the convention, especially its chairman, former president of the Federal Republic of Germany, Roman Herzog, to whom I should like at this point to wish a speedy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">With the exception of the British delegation, our group unanimously supports the Charter. The draft before us is a balanced text which has already been applauded on all sides as an example of European consensus. Obviously, the Charter will not please everyone. No compromise can. But Europe will only progress and find its feet if we are all prepared to help bring about a good result. And that is what has happened with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights has drawn on a multitude of European and national legal sources. It pays homage to the spiritual, religious and moral heritage of our continent and to the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity. The Charter presented to us is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. By placing the individual, people as individuals, at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice, the Charter creates comprehensive transparency. It clearly sets out our citizens' rights for them and clearly sets out the legal positions which the institutions, bodies and agencies of the European Union must comply with and respect when acting on behalf of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter before us is, to my mind, a huge success and may, as I read in one of the European broadsheets on 26 September 2000, become the calling card for Europe. As I pointed out during discussions on how to handle the Charter henceforth during the plenary debate on the Biarritz EU summit of 3 October this year, what is at issue now is the future of the European Union from this point on.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying yes, we are instructing you, Madam President, to proclaim the Charter with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at the EU summit in Nice in a few weeks' time. Although, in our view, even this solemn act in Nice cannot but be a step along the way. The European Union has long been more than an economic community. If we, as the representatives and trustees of the citizens of the European Union and of Europe as a whole, wish to continue with the unification of our continent in an ambitious and committed manner, then the solemn proclamation cannot but be a first step along the way. We in the European People's Party are jointly and firmly committed to including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaties as quickly as possible so that it can become a Charter of direct and unassailable rights for the people of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you have taken a stand here and I hear what you are saying but let me say quite clearly on behalf of the European People's Party that we expect an ambitious result from Nice – an ambitious result on the conditions for enlargement of the European Union and an ambitious result for the Charter, which is why I again call on the Presidency of the Council, on behalf of the members of the European People's Party, to ensure that a timetable is drawn up for transposing the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the EU Treaties. I wish the French Presidency every success here. If you are successful, it will be a joint success for the European Parliament and all the people in the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the history of European integration there are certain moments that can be considered as points of historic change, and this is one of them, because the adoption of the Charter by Parliament will be one more step towards realising the dreams and plans of the founding fathers. I would like to remind you that the first time that the declaration of rights was discussed was at the Congress of Europe in The Hague in 1948, and that was the origin of the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe. Now, as the European Union, we are once again affirming that this is a community of values. We have given real substance to European citizenship, which is recognised in the Treaty on European Union, and we have consolidated our area, not only as an internal market, but also as a legal area in which fundamental human rights are recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">For socialists and social democrats from across Europe, the adoption of the Charter also represents the fulfilment of a commitment to our electorate; we contested the elections with a manifesto containing twenty-one priorities, and a fundamental one among them was to push for a European Charter of Rights in order to enshrine the fundamental civil, economic, social and cultural rights of the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Summit in Cologne, under the German Presidency of Chancellor Schröder, proposed specifically on the one hand, the outline, which became a Convention and, on the other hand, that this Charter should be drawn up. It gave the Convention a mandate and nominated a former President of Germany, Roman Herzog, as chairman of this body. I think that this needs to be highlighted today because the work that we have carried out is not the exclusive property of any political family, and this gesture does credit to the German Presidency at the time and shows that we all need to move forward together in achieving fundamental values. I think that we have also done this in the European Parliament. I have had the opportunity to express my admiration for the work carried out by Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, as chairman of the European Parliament delegation. I would also like to point out the crucial role played by my colleague Mrs Pervenche Berès, when she led the delegation from the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I think that we can all be proud of this success, which is a shared one.</p>
<p class="contents">Today Europe is more than just a common market, and what is more we have a fundamental piece of what should be a future constitution. However, despite all the efforts that have been made, there is still a fundamental step that we need to take in order to feel satisfied – and I say this thinking about the Nice Summit – which is the last point mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council: the inclusion of the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty. I think that, apart from the repeated personal support of the President-in-Office of the Council, there is a series of factors in favour of this. Currently, the majority of Heads of State and Government belong to our political family. Others do not, but they are in favour of this inclusion and of a reformed and democratic Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter provides the Union with an essential legitimacy as a community of values, and we need to emphasise this, because we have also experienced events that show that Article 7 needs to have a much more solid support. Our governments need to obtain tangible results in Nice that they can offer to our citizens – institutional matters are important but, as the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner are well aware, they are difficult to sell to public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter also sets out the Copenhagen criteria, which we consider to be fundamental in the membership negotiations. I would also say, thinking about the countries that are negotiating with us, that it also offers them guarantees with regard to us; that is to say, it is not merely a declaration, but a factor that fits perfectly into the negotiation process. Therefore, my Group still thinks that it is absolutely essential to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6(2) of the Treaty. As I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council is going to have a very busy weekend with the next meeting, I ask him to pass on a message to that meeting, so that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs can pass it on to the Heads of Government. It is as follows: if the European Council in Nice does not succeed in integrating the Charter in this way, I am afraid that the European Parliament will have difficulty approving the reform of the Treaties. I think that this is a positive message that the President-in-Office of the Council must give to his colleagues, because we still have time to include the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaties. After Nice we will be able to start talking about the European constitution. For now, the important thing is for this stage to be consolidated.</p>

<p class="contents">They have shown that European issues can be worked with in a new and exemplary way, a way superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference because of its open and democratic method of working, involving full public control and opportunities for citizens to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that European cooperation is not only based upon economic agreements has been mentioned in this Chamber on a number of occasions. This has become additionally clear in the course of last year. The growth of xenophobic and anti-democratic movements brings the issue of common European values to a head.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European institutions acquire ever more power over citizens, it is also important to place limits upon this influence. The proposed Charter is <span class="italic">unique</span> in the way it gives a central place to the citizen and her rights. Naturally, political compromises have also been made. There has been give and take but, on the whole, what we have here is a catalogue of common and modern rights which give clear and concrete form to the European community of values. Because there is a certain amount of concern about this, it is important to point out that the Charter supplements, rather than competes with, the Council of Europe’s Charter of Human Rights. It is therefore important that, no later than in Nice, the legal opportunity should be created for the EU to sign the Council of Europe’s Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Nice Summit, the Charter will be accepted in the form of a political declaration. This must not be transformed into a mere ceremony with the vaguest of declarations. People are tired of this type of event. It must be made clear that the Charter is to be regarded as morally binding.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as possible after the Summit, the Swedish Presidency must also establish the procedures for working on the Charter’s continued status, the objective being that, following certain changes, it should become binding and part of a future European constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some think it a success and others now think it a thwarted ambition. Many people thought that Europe at long last had the opportunity to emerge from the single free-trade area and the liberal rut in order to establish the foundation of a People’s Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything conspired to strengthen this hope: the formation of the Convention which established a new precedent in relation to the usual intergovernmental method, the public debates and the full set of texts available on an Internet site that was accessible to everyone, as well as the fact that the opinion of civil society was consulted. Transparency was no substitute, however, for the democratic deficit, as the NGOs were only given five minutes to speak and their points were only rarely taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">So, yes, some progress was made, but not enough to compensate for the omissions. It took many weeks of battling to incorporate the right to strike into the Charter. The right to employment was transformed into the right to work. The right to health, social security, accommodation or a minimum income either do not feature, or are expressed only as a token of social cohesion. Freedom of the press is no longer ‘guaranteed’, only ‘respected’. Minority rights are the minimum possible. Discrimination between European and third country residents is ratified, as is the freedom of movement laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, or the right to live as a family, even though this is recognised in international law. A great many rights, including political rights, become subject to a European preference in place of national preference.</p>
<p class="contents">So what has become of our sacrosanct principle that the law shall be universal, indivisible and unique? What has become of European citizenship, the heart of this Europe of equality for all citizens? We are left with a feeling of bitterness. This Charter is the extension of a liberal Europe which is opposed to the social Europe of the citizens. What attitude can we possibly adopt now with regard to this text which is no better than nothing since it falls short of existing rights?</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter as it stands is in no position to become ‘meaningful’ for the citizens of Europe. All it brings is an added value; it does not remotely meet their expectations or their requirements. As regards fundamental rights, is it possible to accept a minimal common denominator at a time when Europe wishes to set itself up as a role model for human rights? We must refuse to be satisfied with this minimalist Charter to which the Social Democrats of Europe appear to have resigned themselves. The Charter cannot serve as a smokescreen for the French Presidency in order to conceal an IGC that is on its last legs.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Summit in Nice, in December, civil society resolved to mobilise in order to make itself heard and to forcefully express its desire for a charter offering the citizens of Europe genuine guarantees. We must support these actions and, rather than accepting a shaky text, we must call upon the Convention to continue working after Nice, involving new procedures and extensive public debate. It is not just our rights and our freedoms but our democracy which is at stake here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? First, because it secures the rights of our citizens vis-à-vis the institutions and bodies of the European Union. Secondly, because it plugs a gap in the protection of fundamental rights for people living in the Union. Thirdly, because the Charter also ensures that the current level of protection in the European Human Rights Convention also applies in the Union; in fact, at some points, it goes even further than the European Human Rights Convention. Fourthly, because the Charter – and this is particularly important for me – is based on indivisible civil and political human rights and fundamental social rights. As a member of the convention, I argued for even further-reaching social rights, especially for the right to work and to a minimum, subsistence-level income to be enshrined in the Charter which, given the current social charter, it should have been.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I share the overall appraisal of the European Trade Union Confederation that, despite the narrow interpretation of social rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an important step on the road towards a social Europe and a citizens' Europe and is a decided improvement over the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I think that what we need now, especially in the run up to Nice, is a comprehensive public debate with our citizens on the text of the Charter; we must also consider how to give them the opportunity to agree to this Charter. I personally am in favour of a European referendum on the Charter, as this would enable the very citizens of Europe to give us democratic authorisation to press ahead and build up Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such was the case with the Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, signed in Strasbourg during a European Council, which appeared to have discharged the institutions' undertaking to resolve the issues related to the protection of workers' dignity. And then the recantation: in actual fact, in Maastricht, Great Britain did not sign the social chapter, going back on the profuse rhetoric which it had lavishly dispensed when proclaiming the vital importance of signing the Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, let us endeavour to ensure that this situation is not repeated in the case of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. To this end, besides the signatures, it is important for there to be effective political undertakings implemented within the timeframe – every day – by all the countries and political forces. The Charter cannot be amended and this gives rise to a democratic deficit, leading us to support the Biarritz conclusions not to consider it to be legally binding. In fact, if it were possible to amend the Charter, if it were admitted that the Charter does not provide for duties and does not provide fully for rights, things would be easier: the Charter does not go far enough in protecting the natural family or safeguarding children; it disregards the need for rules to regulate every new global information technology; it discriminates between private and public education; with regard to safeguarding the environment, it disregards the protection of health and animal rights; it is too general with regard to consumer protection and leaves the door open to the marketing of extremely harmful foodstuffs. In addition, there are political gaps in the Charter such as the fact that it does not tackle the issue of political refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we feel that the Charter is only important as a position of principle, as a starting point for a debate: a debate which we consider useful for the future but which has yet to develop, which must take place alongside the unification process. We will assign to this Charter the value of a political declaration, committing ourselves together: we will therefore vote for the recommendation and the <span class="italic">Alleanza Nazionale</span> will enter into a democratic debate that will supplement and finalise the content of the Charter over the coming months, and which will evolve alongside the accession process and the new European citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Charter, as you know, has no legal basis, nor does it provide for any body capable of enforcing compliance with the rights and principles it proclaims. This Charter is just another empty text, and the appeals from Mr Barón Crespo and others to include a reference to the Charter in Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not going to change a thing. We are aware, in the Austrian case, for example, that Europe went outside the scope of the Treaty in responding with bilateral measures, and it was not empowered, there being no authorisation under Articles 6 and 7, to ensure respect for the fine principles to which it claims to adhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is more important than that. The Cologne Council had the bright idea of thinking up a bone to keep the dog busy, the dog in question being the European Parliament, and so it invented this Charter, and Parliament, as it is increasingly accustomed to doing, threw itself upon the proffered bone and gave it a good chew, to such an extent that we are, today, completely under the illusion that we are taking part in some historic event. Yet the real issues before us are the blank pages of the French Presidency’s executive summary, the issue of the Commission and the issue of the weighting of votes within the Council, and Parliament, which has always adopted a strong line with the weak and a weak attitude towards the strong and which is going increasingly downhill in its way of approaching matters, can find nothing to say about this planned destruction of the Commission. It is going along with this sideways shift which is turning the executive Commission into a sub-council, an underling of a Council which is and will be stronger yet.</p>
<p class="contents">What is actually on the agenda of the Nice Summit is the slide towards intergovernmentalism firmly anchored in the texts. You can accept the situation, you can let off steam by producing great empty texts, but that is the reality of the situation and it is distressing to note that the small countries of the European Union, in persisting in wanting one Commissioner per Member State, are supporting the plan of undermining the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently conspiring to kill off the Commission, a murder with a willing victim, since the Commission fell in with the Council’s proposals last week. So let us either lament or pretend to rejoice, let us celebrate this great event which is actually just a perfectly empty great event. I think we ought to remind ourselves of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether we vote for this Charter, against it, or abstain altogether, nothing will change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Behind the vote on the Charter, there is an ill-concealed agenda to create the first part of a constitution for what might be called a United States of Europe. The Charter will not, of course, be written into the Treaty until after a special constitutional conference in 2004 but, as it receives the solemn signature of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, the European Court of Justice will already be acquiring a new source for its judgements, and the Court of Justice’s representative has, of course, already given notice that it will draw inspiration from the Charter. The Commission’s representative at the Turin Convention attaches judicial significance to the document. It is therefore absurd for the Danish Government to maintain that there is no trace of anything new in the Charter. In that case, what purpose is served by the text?</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Charter contains innovations in relation to existing law. For example, there is a ban on discrimination against national minorities, which is good, and there is new wording on positive discrimination in favour of the under-represented sex and new rules on cloning, the protection of personal data and the right of access to documents. The problem is not the content but the aim, which is to go one better than the national constitutions and the European Declaration of Human Rights. The European Court of Justice will become our new Supreme Court and constitutional court, including in all issues relating to fundamental and human rights, and it will also become the chief interpreter of the European Declaration of Human Rights. In the Convention, I tabled amendments to the effect that the Charter should conform to the national constitutional courts and the Court of Human Rights. The very fact that it was not possible to adopt these amendments witnesses to the aim of creating a constitution. Unfortunately, I must therefore vote against the Charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The convention did a grand job. With this result, Minister, Europe has created an awareness of its intellectual principles, which we can use to measure what holds it together at its very core. Many new rights for children, the elderly and the disabled are mentioned, together – and I find this most interesting – with a new freedom to conduct a business which is almost tantamount to a sort of ban on socialism.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is, to all intents and purposes. And anyway you are social democrats, not socialists. It is also important for me that the preamble refers quite clearly to spiritual/religious principles, because anyone who denies his roots cannot grow and if you cannot grow, you cannot blossom. And we want a Europe which blossoms, prospers and grows, which is why we wanted and were right to refer to our roots.</p>
<p class="contents">So what happens next? The Charter of Fundamental Rights is to become part of a future European constitutional treaty – a constitutional treaty, mind you, not a constitution –, in order to make it perfectly clear that the European Union is not a state, it is not a nation state; on the contrary, the European Union goes its own separate way. The nation states still have their special position and it is they and only they which can amend the treaties through the usual ratification process. This is what we mean when we talk of a constitutional treaty rather than a constitution. If we are want to be credible, then we cannot apply the concepts of 19th and 20th century constitutional case law to the development of the European Union; we must develop special new concepts. That is why we are right to say not state but union of states, Commission or Executive rather than government, constitutional treaty rather than constitution. If we want Europe to succeed, we need to define these concepts clearly; if we want Europe to succeed, we need a streamlined Europe. We want Europe to succeed and that means that the principles must be right, the concepts – the clearly-defined concepts – must be right, the division of powers must be right and then perhaps, at the next European elections in 2004, we will be in a position to present a constitutional treaty, a complete constitutional treaty which will win the citizens' confidence and convince the experts. Success starts with clear concepts.</p>

Now that we have had the single market, it is now time for a Europe of rights The concept of citizenship within the European Union is a relatively new one.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that this was originally an initiative from Felipe Gonzales, who proposed this fine idea. Since then, it has been expanded upon and brought to life. Until now, it existed only in the form of an anthem, a passport, but now, I feel that with this Charter, it also will have some substance, the definition of rights as they are stated in this fine text. It is a fine text because it is readable, clear, precise and framed with an eye to the future – well, we shall see, but in the meantime, as of right now, it is possible to read it as if it were a legal text, and that is what we sought to achieve. For women, too, it is a text that represents some progress since it is couched in gender-neutral terms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also, however, a text whose content we can be proud of, as it is well balanced. The first right it stipulates is the right to dignity. How can we fail to recognise that in the twenty-first century, once the concept of dignity has been set forth, the key thing is the indivisibility of the whole package of rights? So individual rights and citizens’ rights are included, but also social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware of how difficult the Cologne mandate was. Some say it was a balanced mandate, others that it was inadequate, but it was a mandate whose dynamic force we used to the full, and even almost exceeded. Some Members of this House, including in my own political family, in the widest sense, will deplore the lack of reference to a minimum income, the right to accommodation or the lack of any explicit reference to the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights in the general provisions of the text. I would, however, urge them to read the text carefully. Going on the speeches that I have heard this morning, I am not sure that everyone has read this text properly and grasped its full scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly discuss the scope of the text. I would urge those that are of the opinion that the text does not go far enough as regards social rights to consider the legal status of the texts we currently have available to us on social rights at the European level. The Charter has actually been drawn up as if it were a text which might become binding. It goes well beyond the texts with which we identify in political terms but which, from the viewpoint of the legal instrument implementing them, even if they, of course, are based on common policies, do not, however, in legal terms define any real rights which might, eventually, be recognised by a judge.</p>
<p class="contents">You have to realise that this is a text which must be brought to life. To adopt an expression used by Catherine Lalumière, I would say that we have to “put it into orbit”. In order to do so, we all need to work hand in hand, on the basis of, I hope, the largest possible vote by this House. This means that we must all get involved, Members of the European Parliament, members of the national parliaments, the Council, of course, the national government, but also that same civil society which supported us in the process of drawing up the text.</p>
<p class="contents">If I might briefly turn to the legal status of the text, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you referred to the work of the IGC last night. My impression was that, even though several governments did not want it, there might still be a clear majority in favour of a reference in Article 6. That is not the be all and end all for this Charter’s status. It will ultimately have to have its rightful place as the preamble to a constitution, but that is a matter for our long-term institutional development. In the short term, we remain committed to its being referred to in Article 6. This is the mandate we have given our representatives. As far as Parliament is concerned, the phase we are about to enter is the outcome of a long struggle, one we undertook as early as 1975 and which has been continually highlighted through our resolutions, our Spinelli draft treaties, our draft European constitutions. When we come to vote, I would hope that we shall be able to have the maximum number of Members in the House in order to give you the maximum support, Madam President, when you proclaim the Charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The right to good administration, which Mrs Malmström also talked about, is one of the most important advances of all. That right does not exist in other international documents, and it is absent from the constitutions of many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to a more open administration is one of the most practical improvements the Charter can offer our EU citizens. The Charter also opens the way to minority rights because Article 22 says that the European Union must respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity. Such respect, combined with a ban on discrimination, creates a basis for securing the position of minorities in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The method of working has been a success. It has been so successful that, in his speech last Friday, the Finnish Prime Minister singled out the method as a way of coming up with ideas in anticipation of a future EU constitution. This is something I consider to be important. It is also important, however, that the EU should subscribe to the Conventions on Human Rights. The two belong together.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am delighted to note that children too are mentioned. I hope that this provides a basis for Commissioner Vitorino to take measures to ensure that the EU can make a contribution before this autumn's summit on the position of children. I am also very proud to see that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country, Gunnar Jansson, played a very important role when this Charter was drawn up. I believe he has contributed to the clarity to which Mrs Berès referred in this Chamber. The Charter is clear and concise and could be a model for many other constitutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I not only thank them but envy them. An extraordinarily fine job has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a text here which states concisely what Europe is about and states what rights we uphold as citizens of this great Union. I am sad, indeed, to see the ranks of British Conservatives have lined up against the idea of making the institutions of the Union answerable to breaches of the rights of the citizens of the Union. It is a sad thing that the party of Churchill and Maxwell Fyfe should have come to this point that, when we at last try to ensure that the institutions of the Union are not the tyrants of Brussels but persons subject under Article 51 to the obligations binding on all institutions of the Union, the British Conservatives say "no".</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure yet, because I have not heard from them, how far Mr Blair's hounds will be let free from the leash to speak out for this brilliant project. I hope that Mr Martin, who did such a fine job in helping at this convention, will be persuading his colleagues that the time has come not merely to adopt this Charter but to make it part of our law, binding upon those who govern us, not merely a proclamation but a binding part of the Treaties. Perhaps the best we can do for the time being is get it mentioned in Article 6 but that will only be for starters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a perfect document; we all know it is not a perfect document. Nothing in life is perfect and it is also not perfect to declare rights but not uphold them effectively. I do note that there are articles about the presumption of innocence and about the principles of legality and the right to defence. As I said last night – I will say it again today – there are too many failings in that respect all across this Union and sometimes, in our eagerness to develop judicial and police cooperation, we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent are not made the passive victims, the collateral damage of a war against crime.</p>

I also see the method instigated with the Convention as innovatory with regard to ensuring greater information and greater transparency. Despite all that, however, there is a major source of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a significant gap between our initial ambitions and what we have actually achieved. It is, of course, possible to highlight this or that article, to welcome the genuine progress made in affirming a number of new rights relating to developments in our societies or in reaffirming crucial fundamental rights. It is also possible to pinpoint articles which fall a long way short of the rights acknowledged elsewhere, particular in social issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be drawing up lists of advantages and disadvantages, Madam President. Last time, you spoke of the glass being half full or half empty. We should instead be looking at the Charter in terms of its overall approach and ambition and asking ourselves whether it actually lives up to the demands and expectations of the citizens of Europe and whether it provides them with adequate support to confront the challenges of the age.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, I have read the text. I have read it again and again. It is, indeed, a text that is easy to read. I have heard the arguments put forward by my fellow Members, but I still think that the Charter contains some ambiguous provisions that are very dangerous and that the common denominator is still the lowest possible one.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in spite of the innovative approach of the Convention method, which I have mentioned, things must be stated openly. The citizens of Europe have continued to be insufficiently informed and if they had been consulted, as should have been necessary, in order to contribute towards drawing up the Charter, then its content would almost certainly have been rather different.</p>
<p class="contents">It is never too late to set things right. Nice should not be just the finish line for the Charter, an opportunity to express self-satisfaction. It would be wise to also make it the starting point for the widest possible “citizens’ debate” regarding this so important issue of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, precisely because the decision on the Charter is a major political decision, I am with those Members of the House that think it premature for Parliament to declare its opinion today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both cases, we are asked to approve texts without being told what they are to be used for. Are we talking about a political declaration? Is it an addendum to the Treaty? Is it the first part of a future constitution? We will find out at a later date, after Nice, no doubt. This uncertainty introduces a fundamental flaw into the consent given at the close of work within that body or in today’s votes. Some Members are trying to set their minds at rest thinking that a vote in favour does not commit us to anything, given that the Charter is going to remain nothing more than a formal declaration. A mistake! Because, at the very least, if this text is in fact adopted as it stands – and that is a crucial condition, to which I shall return – it will become binding, by virtue of the Court of Justice case law.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects in this process which I find fascinating. Firstly, the Charter adopted in this way would take us directly to the sort of standardised Europe which the overwhelming majority of Members of this House claim to abhor and which the voters do not want at all. Tomorrow, however, the Court of Justice is going to be able to interpret these rights in detail and the Court’s case law is going to be applied in a standardised fashion throughout Europe, depriving each national democracy of its right of autonomous decision. Ladies and gentlemen, you will not be able to claim that you did not know this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second fascinating aspect is that we are today discussing human rights and citizens’ rights, a subject over which the European Union has no form of jurisdiction. Yet the Cologne Council, with the assistance of the Convention, doing a magnificent job of creating confusion, managed ultimately to make every one forget that this area lay within the jurisdiction of the national parliaments, and that jurisdiction is being gradually spirited out of the hands of these parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the current treaties, today’s debate actually has no legitimacy whatsoever, and that is a poor omen for a Europe which claims to wish to ensure that fundamental rights are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think, and I am addressing my remarks to the Council Presidency in particular at this point, that if the governments meeting in Nice adopt the Charter as a political declaration, they should preface it with some introductory note to the effect that defining and developing citizens’ rights lies, in all instances, within the exclusive remit of the national parliaments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that the present Charter is nothing but a poor imitation in that it raises legal concerns such as the point in Article 2, Paragraph 2, where it states “No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed”. But how can anybody be executed if they have not first been condemned to death? The phrase is excessive, superfluous, absurd! Then it mentions religious rites without establishing any restrictions. For example, the Italian Constitution lays down the limits of public morality and the European Convention lays down the limit of the rights of others and public safety. Are satanic or orgiastic rights permitted or not? This is not clear at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, on the political side, it fails to recognise the right of the self-determination of peoples, and there is no clear definition protecting the natural family. Finally, I feel that, while this procedure which prevents not only any parliament but also the European Parliament amending the Charter, and even prevents it amending the draft decision, on the one hand proclaims the citizens' rights, on the other, it denies the rights of the citizens' representatives, of the Members of this Parliament, who are not even allowed to table an amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, since I am in favour of the Europe of the citizens, I do not feel fully represented by this Charter, and I will therefore not vote for the motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It really is a waste of time! Whose interests are we serving by declaring this Charter? Not the citizens of the Member States, because most of the rights in the Charter are worded so vaguely that any interested party, the institutions included, can interpret it at will. What is more, no provision whatsoever has been made for an effective system of legal protection, should the Charter become legally binding, God forbid.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the document is packed with rights that do nothing to curb the powers of the institutions. As such, the Charter is directed primarily at the Member States, but they have incorporated all the necessary fundamental rights in their own constitutions. Each Member State is a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which provides an additional guarantee for the effective protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can a Charter of this kind bring to the situation, apart from serious confusion? According to Joseph Weiler, the citizens of Europe will soon be suffering from an excess of fundamental rights protection rather than any shortfall in this area. I could not agree with him more. Having too much in the way of fundamental rights protection is just as damaging as having too little. The Charter has turned into a prestige project. As an institution, the European Parliament has the interests of the citizens at heart, and should therefore have no truck with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights has always been a priority for this Parliament, because it has wanted the principles and values that unite Europeans to be reflected in a text. This is particularly important at the present time, when we are beginning an ambitious process of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is because the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an essential factor in the move towards political union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr President, and surely this is the most important reason, because a Charter of Fundamental Rights is going to increase the feeling of belonging to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, my group, as its chairman, Mr Poettering, has already said, is going to vote in favour of this Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this Charter reflects the opinion of Parliament, as we set it out in our Duff/Voggenhuber Resolution on 16 March. The Charter has been drawn up with the participation of a delegation from Parliament and, as chairman of this delegation, I would like to thank all its members for their work, their commitment and their support over all these months.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as one of the speakers said, that we have to make an effort to inform people about the Charter, an effort that can begin in this Parliament. When listening to the speeches from some members, one realises that this information is more necessary than ever. Some people should read the Charter before they speak to prevent them from saying the things that they say.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me to say a few words on the effects of the Charter. I think that there is a false debate. I think that the reference to Article 6 is logical and I think that the President-in-Office of the Council should take note of what Mr Barón Crespo said. The chairman of the group to which the majority of governments in the European Union belong said quite clearly that Parliament – or in any event, his group – will not approve the reform of the Treaty of Nice if no reference is made in Article 6.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is going to have effects, whether or not it is in the Treaty. In fact; it has already had effects. If you read the report of the three wise men on the situation in Austria, you will see that the Charter is mentioned on three occasions. This report was drawn up between 29 August and 6 September, when the Charter had still not been drafted. Therefore, the Charter, whether or not it is included in the Treaties, whether or not it is in Article 6(2), will bind the Commission – and I would like to highlight the important work done by Commissioner Vitorino in drawing up the Charter – will bind Parliament and will bind the Council, and it will have effects, Mr President, whether some Members of this House like it or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, David (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, colleagues who have argued this morning that this Charter does not reflect this or that right strongly enough or indeed at all, or say that it is not Christian Democratic enough or Socialist enough, or Green enough, seem to have missed the whole point of the Charter. This is a Charter that brings together rights that belong to no party and to every party. It is a fusion of existing European values in a contemporary and imaginative way. All sections of the House who are interested in the development of the European Union should welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission says in its excellent communication, and as Mr Moscovici has reminded us this morning, this Charter is unique because it brings together civil, political, economic and social rights in a way that is not contained in any other human rights or fundamental rights charter that exists in the world. It is also, the Commission points out, contemporary because it deals with issues such as bioethics, genetic engineering and data protection as well as access to information. So it is a good step in the right direction. The convention and its chairman, Mr Méndez de Vigo should be congratulated for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The big question that now divides us is what this Charter is for. For me it has three purposes. Firstly, to say to the citizens: Europe is not simply something that happens to you, it is a community that gives you rights, that gives you guarantees, that gives you protection in certain circumstances. Secondly, to say to the institutions: you have a duty, that is expressed in this Charter, to deal with the citizens in a certain way. When you pass legislation, when you take administrative actions, when you draw up documents, you have to abide by the contents of this Charter. Thirdly, it says to both existing Member States and to applicant states that when you become a member of the Community you become a member of a community of values. There are certain conditions that you must maintain and attain to be or to remain a member of the European Union. That is a very clear message, not just to the applicant states but to the existing states. If you think of the fragile political situation in one or two of our Member States, that is an important message to be setting out at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Charter be used? I agree with colleagues who say the Court is not going to ignore a Charter that has been proclaimed solemnly by the three institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament. It is going to bear that Charter in mind when making judgments. That is to be welcomed, not feared as Mr Bonde seems to think. Mr Dupuis and even my own European minister have implied that this is a vacuous or empty document. I cannot accept this. This is a major step forward in the building of Europe. I welcome it.</p>

Those who are more backward and more reactionary have, once again, triumphed over those who are fighting to see fundamental rights applied to all people and for an effective, legally binding response to new issues such as the risks of science, the rights of the new citizens, the right to a healthy environment etc. Consequently, we are once again left disappointed and dissatisfied. We will, of course, vote for the Charter, but we will do so with the feeling that it will not succeed in arousing that enthusiasm and that sense of participation by the citizens of Europe which are so necessary and, as usual, it will be the governments – and some governments more than others – who will have to bear the historical responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The divide between those who have much and those who have little or nothing is growing ever wider, while, precisely in the name of these sacred principles, those who have much are exacting increasing sacrifices from those who have little or nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights, with its constant referral to national laws and practices for the actual implementation of social rights, is liable to render irreversible this subordination, this unfair system of the wealthy few, this model of a liberal free trade<span class="bold"> </span>society which is rising like a phoenix from the ashes of European social democratic ideals with striking speed. This Charter on social rights is a step backwards compared to the laws of many of the Member States and, thanks precisely to the referrals to these laws, it will serve as a tool to alter them or limit their effectiveness. Civil and political rights are empty, formal rights if they are merely listed in a document and not based on actual social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the century which is coming to a close, with all its battles to emancipate the under-privileged social classes, has been in vain and has taught us nothing. We cannot pretend that this Charter is an initial step towards a Union based on increasing solidarity. Rather, it is the bare minimum in terms of future social policies. I only hope that it will not be incorporated into the Treaties and that movements calling for a fairer Europe, in which there is a genuine increase in solidarity, will flourish in civil society, in the trade unions and in political organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ultimately, the debate is about whether the EU is to be founded upon normal constitutional principles. The Charter fills a gap in EC law and strengthens the individual’s protection against infringements by European police, by authorities which combat fraud and by authorities which regulate competition. In spite of the fact that, in practice, we now already impose penalties, there are no normal opportunities for investigating infringements of human rights, and such opportunities are necessary in a society governed by law.</p>
<p class="contents">Every individual – woman, man, employee and entrepreneur – must be protected against possible political and administrative injustices perpetrated by the EU. There are <span class="italic">no</span> respectable arguments for opposing this particular requirement. Anyone who unlawfully suffers prejudice due to the European Union’s legal remedies must be entitled to have the matter legally examined. If it is going to be possible to develop a competitive, enlarged Europe, the latter must be founded upon constitutional principles. Broad political support is required for the individual’s right to have injustices legally investigated. How, otherwise, will a legal area of 500 million people be able to operate?</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter constitutes a balanced and solid basis for enlargement. There are many misunderstandings concerning its material content and consequences. These misunderstandings must be cleared up. For those who feel the need to do so, I recommend reading the explanations in Convention 49 and also studying that case law from both courts which is bound up with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter will influence the development of law in the EU and, gradually, it will probably acquire more and more support.

In my opinion, the only people who can justify voting against the adoption of the Charter are those who are against the European Union, as some of those who have spoken today clearly are. I do not understand how anyone can reject the Charter because it does not cover everything which they would like it to. The hopes of no one person here have been fully realised because the Charter cannot mirror the views of one section of the population alone, it must be the common point of reference of all those who feel that they are European citizens, in respect for the differences of others and peaceful co-existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Could we have done better? I think so, if only because not everything I proposed was accepted. In this case, would it be better not to do anything? Should we reject the Charter? Certainly not! I repeat, this Charter turns the Union into a Community of rights; it is a step forwards in the process of constitutionalisation of the Union and it is the first international document to contain, according to the principle of the indivisibility of fundamental rights, civil and political rights, economic and social rights and new rights, all together. I fail to understand those who say that it is useless and that it is made up of nothing but generalisations and fine words. To assert this is to disregard the history of the institutions: 'liberty, equality, fraternity’ are also fine words, but they formed the basis of many of Europe's legal systems. It is on the basis of formulae such as these articles that, in time, our law-courts guaranteed our fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us leave it to cynical reactionaries to maintain that only strength or money count for anything and that anything else is merely words. No, the words which embody our principles, our values and our fundamental rights are powerful if we embrace them and apply them to our civil lifestyles. Therefore, let us adopt the Charter and take the words it contains seriously, let us prevent them being diluted, undervalued or ignored. We must take our rights seriously if we want governments to respect them and legal systems to guarantee them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think there is a problem in maintaining that social rights must be indivisible and universal and then, at one and the same time in the section headed ‘Solidarity’, referring to national legislation and practice. In this way, it is precisely what is universal and indivisible in these areas that is weakened. It is that part of the content I have problems with. However, I also have problems with the structure we are in the process of setting up. If we really want to reinforce human rights at European level, we ought instead to employ our energy on strengthening the work of the Council of Europe and on having the EU ratify the European Convention on Human Rights and the corresponding conventions on cultural and social rights, instead of slowly developing a system to compete with the Council of Europe, as we are now in the process of doing. Indeed, the Council of Europe represents the whole of Europe, or all European States. We have only fifteen of them – as yet. Finally, there is the problem of wanting to establish a constitution without democratic backing. That will not get the voting numbers up at the next elections to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time since the European Union was established we have here the basis of a constitution, a constitution for the supranational structure that is the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sound document in our view, and we feel it does justice to our standards and values as Christian Democrats. It articulates to good effect the right to human dignity and integrity of the person. The same applies to respect for the family and family life, and the way in which the rights of children, the elderly and the disabled are formulated. In this way, the Charter provides additional protection for the most vulnerable members of Europe’s society, and that is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter also strikes the right balance. In addition to the social rights, which are well articulated, the text also cites the right to have the freedom to conduct a business and to choose an occupation. It therefore strikes the right balance between those rights that are particularly dear to the hearts of the trade unions, and the rights that are more likely to be asserted by employers organisations and small and medium-sized organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">My third observation concerns the rights of citizens from third countries. Here too we have articles that protect citizens against discrimination, for example on the labour market. That was another of our group’s aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">pièce de résistance</span> of the Charter is Article 21, the big anti-discrimination article. This prohibits discrimination in sixteen areas. I regard it as the jewel in the crown of this Charter. This article will prove much needed, considering the way things are going and given the amount of discrimination, racism and xenophobia at large in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it was a great honour to be able to work with my colleagues in the European Parliament and from the national parliaments on drawing up this Charter. We would like to thank Roman Herzog and Iñigo Méndez de Vigo for steering the convention to such outstanding effect and we sincerely hope that the Charter will be endorsed in Nice with the signature of our President Nicole Fontaine.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, let us hope that our European citizens will frequently turn to this Charter when their rights come under fire. It is intended to be for their benefit, and we hope they will take this on board with gratitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sixty thousand people are expected from the ETUC organisations alone. This rally is not a demonstration against the Charter. There appear to be people from among these circles who are under this impression and who would probably be inclined to, but they have completely missed the point. It is a demonstration for a social and democratic Europe of the citizens. The Charter is part and parcel of the shift in this direction, and of the dynamics at work for a strong and social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the social and economic fundamental rights are particularly dear to my heart. The EU Charter must be firmly rooted in the Council of Europe’s Social Charter as well as the ECHR. Shall I tell you what struck me last week when Prodi and Verheugen presented the progress report on enlargement? It was the little table at the back concerning the ratification of fundamental rights conventions. If you compare it with a table of the current Member States, they appear to score lower than the candidate countries, at least when it comes to the Council of Europe’s revised Social Charter. I must say I find that extremely embarrassing.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Charter will have legal force, even if it is not yet binding. The Court of Justice made this crystal-clear at its last assembly on 2 October. However, the institutions that are about to commit the solemn act of signing up to the Charter must not just leave it to the lawyers to deal with. For a start, they must incorporate an amendment to Article 6 of the EU Treaty. They must set a course for the articles of the Charter to be included, in a binding manner, in the Treaty, and there is a need for supervisory procedures, reporting obligations, independent experts and complaints procedures. The Council of Europe, along with the Court of Human Rights, has a wealth of experience of such forms of supervision, and we can build on these.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we must get the message across that Nice will not be the end of the road for the Charter, but only the beginning. Fundamental Rights, the heart of Europe: the rallying cry of the ETUC and the NGO contingents will remain highly topical in the coming months. That is what we will take to the streets of Nice for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some proponents of a European constitution or a Charter, by way of an interim step in this direction, see this as an opportunity to make up lost ground in one fell swoop. There are other proponents of a European constitution who see things differently. They want a propaganda document, the main aim of which will be to describe the current European Union and justify the future development of a single European superstate, and from which no new rights whatsoever ensue from the point of view of EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the first aim and reject the second. The draft Charter of Fundamental Rights within the European Union is a vague compromise between these two conflicting views, with the second taking precedence over the first. For some rights it will even mean a retrograde step. That is why this document is not yet ready for decision-making. In the short term, it is far more important for the European Union to give its commitment to the already existing European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe. In the meantime, the draft Charter can serve as an interesting subject for debate amongst the parties, trade unions, environmental organisations, churches and the many other groupings in the Member States and the candidate states of the Union, regarding future cooperation between European nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European institutions have power and, for the sake of our citizens, we must set limits on this power. It is high time that we plugged the gaps in the protection of European fundamental rights. The debate as to whether the Union should not simply accede to the European Convention on Human Rights just as the Member States do has gone on for years. I, for one, am delighted that, for a variety of reasons, the Union has not acceded to the Convention on Human Rights</p>
<p class="contents">As it stands, the Charter which we shall be voting for today – I hope by a large majority –, will clearly afford us better protection of our fundamental rights which is more in keeping with the times than acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights would have done. Just under one-third of the Charter contains the same guarantees as the Convention on Human Rights. The rest, for the most part, ups the ante when it comes to citizens' political rights, economic and social rights and, last but not least, the issues of tomorrow – environmental, health and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter must become European law if it really is to do its job. The step which we are taking today is just one step on the long road ahead. The solemn proclamation must pave the way for binding European constitutional law.</p>
<p class="contents">Does today's step mark the start of a movement which will end in a European superstate? No, it does not. The demand for fundamental Union rights, combined with the request that the treaties be constitutionalised, does not mean that a United States of Europe lies at the end of the road. But we do need a constitutional text for Europe as quickly as possible, a text for our citizens containing clear, comprehensible statements on Europe, telling them what rights they have, where the Union has taken over responsibility, what powers the Member States should exercise, including in the future, and how Europe intends to do its job, with every guarantee that the rule of law will protect their human rights. We must keep working on this. We must move in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to emphasise, with considerable pride, the active and committed participation of Commissioner António Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to focus on three points that have already been raised by other Members here this morning. First of all, there is the commendable way in which this Convention functioned. This is merit that should be retained and encouraged for future projects, specifically future revisions of the European Union Treaties. Secondly, I wish to focus on the binding nature of this Charter. The European public would not understand if Europe were to move faster in making improvements to the market and the currency but more slowly in effectively establishing its rights of citizenship and its basic rights. Thirdly, I wish to emphasise, as has already been done, that the Nice conclusions and, specifically, the revision of the Treaty, should include this reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6(2). The pomp and circumstance surrounding the signing and the proclamation of the Charter are not enough; these rights must be effectively put into practice. That is why, once again, we urge and insist that the Presidency should be able to exercise the role of teacher towards its peers in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have two proposals: firstly, the signing and ratification of this Charter of Fundamental Rights by their parliaments should be part of existing Community rules for candidate countries. Secondly, the Nice conclusions should establish a precise timetable for future presidencies to be able to move from this Charter to the Treaty, and I would suggest that the deadline should be set to coincide with ratification by all parliaments of the new revision of the Treaties that will result from Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as has been pointed out many times, the text does not have the legal status of a treaty. This is why we need to take further steps forward. The final objective is to establish a European Constitution, a fundamental law for a Union, which cannot stop at simply having a single currency but must become a political entity with genuinely common foreign and defence policies, an interlocutor on a par with the United States which will be able to take up the great challenge of globalisation in which the countries of the continent of Asia are also set to become protagonists in the coming years, starting with China.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, the Charter only represents the start of what is going to be a difficult, time-consuming task, but a task which, at the same time, excites enthusiasm. The text which we are going to adopt today, parts of which, being the result of a compromise – as President Poettering said – fail to satisfy us, must be instrumental in triggering a large-scale debate on the future and on the future European Constitution. The Charter of Fundamental Rights must confer binding legal status upon the rights and establish the levels of responsibility of the Union, the States and the regions, and it must bear the people's seal of approval. This is why it has to be debated and endorsed by this and the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the conviction that the Europe of the future must increasingly safeguard individual rights and the rights of the family and that it must prevent the return of new forms of racism and anti-Semitism, the Members of <span class="italic">Forza Italia</span> and the European People's Party will vote for the recommendation accompanying the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think some very skilful work has been done. The Charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon. It is a Charter which, to a large degree, accords the human being a central place. I want to highlight a couple of important points. Firstly, I think it is good to have made it clear that the Convention on Human Rights and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are to be respected. It is important that these two bodies should not lose their authority. At the same time, I think it is important to state that the common values must be established with reference to the different cultures and traditions we have in Europe. I believe it is important to keep this in mind if we are to obtain the necessary backing for the Charter from Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to highlight a particularly positive feature of the Charter, namely its concern with the issue of establishing very far-reaching provisions to rule out discrimination against minorities. That is something which I think is very much to be welcomed. I also think it is good to have been far-sighted enough to have included new areas of protection in the picture. I am thinking both of the environment and of biotechnology. I believe that adopting the Charter in Nice will be a powerful signal to certain applicant countries of the seriousness with which the EU regards respect for the fundamental freedoms. Finally, I must say that I am very pleased that the Charter is being adopted in Nice as a political document. I believe it will be a good basis for the dialogue we must have with the people of Europe about Europe’s future development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that is all by the by. What we needed was a European consensus and that is what we have got. This is the most modern fundamental rights document in the world today and it really does deserve our special appreciation. As far as I can see, the convention has extracted everything worth its weight in fundamental rights from over 31 legal sources. It has clarified the bedrock of values of the European Union and I call on all those who have spoken and who, for example miss the lack of political responsibility in the Charter – heaven forbid – to appreciate the fact that, as stated in the preamble, this text has been formulated in an awareness of the spiritual, religious and moral heritage of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make one further point. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to secure sufficient coverage in the Charter for the rights of minorities. The European Parliament delegation wanted to take account of ethnic minorities but failed to persuade the convention as a whole. In my view this is a failing and it should have been mentioned. And a word to our critics. It is standard practice for journalists to criticise politicians. That is all well and good and that is how it should be, but I should like to turn the tables for once and give our critics, i.e. the journalists, a taste of their own medicine: you have failed right along the line. We have been working on this text of fundamental rights publicly and transparently for nine months and the whole of the European press has failed to tell our citizens anything about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within Europe, the European citizen knows that Europe is now not just an economic entity; within the candidate countries, no country will be able to aspire to join the European Union without ensuring that its national legal system adheres to the principles of the Charter; and finally, on the world scale, this is the message sent out by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, other effects, particularly on our internal legal system. I shall, of course, add my voice to those of the men and women wishing to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6, and to actually incorporate the Charter itself into the Treaties at a later date. Indeed, how is it possible for a single moment to think that Parliament’s adopting the Charter will not have any legal implications? Traditionally, the national parliaments are the guardians of public freedoms, yet here we have a rather unusual method because in parliamentary law, there is no legislation by proclamation.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall shortly be officially adopting this Charter as formally as possible and, I would hope, with the largest possible majority, and there will be any number of courts to draw conclusions from it even if it is not incorporated into the Treaties in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is yet another effect it will have, and this is on our own working methods. Let me give you an example of this. My fellow members on the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs did me the honour of appointing me rapporteur on the issue of respect for human rights within the Europe Union. I have, of course, to take the ‘pre-’ and ‘post-’ Charter situations into account. Once adopted by this House, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will serve as a benchmark for my report and, as far as I can with my own personal and intellectual resources and those of the people assisting me, I shall carry out an evaluation, right by right and country by country, of the extent to which the Charter is respected in the fifteen countries of the European Union. We, the Members of the European Parliament, are accountable for the regulations that we adopt with a philosophy which must not be that of zero infringement of human rights. We need not be naively optimistic, we shall surely find instances of human rights violations, but collectively we have a duty to ensure that it is possible to bring a legal case against such infringements, that there is a suitable court to prosecute such crimes, and a public administrative body to investigate them and prevent them recurring. This, in any case, will be the your rapporteur’s working philosophy, ladies and gentlemen, once we have adopted, as we are shortly about to do, the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For instance, in the area of criminal law the abrogation of the right to extradite fugitives to countries which allow the death penalty could mean that Europe becomes a sanctuary for American murderers. The enshrining of the double jeopardy principle would be embarrassing to the British government who have now decided they will abolish it. Secondly, anti-discrimination provisions are ludicrously wide-ranging and open to abuse. These rights open the door for demands for homosexual marriage and adoption, and language discrimination clauses might prohibit the refusal to employ EU doctors in the United Kingdom who do not speak English. They might even threaten the Thatcherite trade union reforms in the United Kingdom of the eighties.</p>
<p class="contents">Most worrying is the Orwellian possibility under Article 52 of the suspension of fundamental rights when the interests of the European Union are at stake. We have already seen the case of Bernard Connolly whose critical book regarding the Commission was suppressed by the Court of First Instance. Are we to see a situation come about in which only politically correct statements about the EU will be tolerated in future? This Charter is not only potentially damaging but unnecessary given the fact that we already have the European Convention on Human Rights which was supported in 1950 by the great Conservative, Winston Churchill, and Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">We have witnessed the hypocrisy in this House when the left-wing were not prepared to support my motion on the Italian royal family's rights being restored. We already see the effects of judicial activism in Britain taking powers from our national parliament. We could now see unelected judges extending this considerably in Europe. All this will do is to establish a competitive jurisdiction between the European Court of Justice and the Court of Human Rights and play into the hands, or should I say the pockets, of already overpaid litigation lawyers. Lastly, it will fuel claims that the EU is hell-bent on proclaiming a federal constitution with a charter as its first chapter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union is a giant of the world's economy but it still lacks a soul. Although the Free Trade Area is growing and the democratic deficit is being reduced, the risk that competitiveness will start to conflict with mutual support and that a free market will encourage nostalgia for the past in social and territorial contexts which feel that their traditions and security are under threat is also on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter has many supporters but also many enemies, and we have heard the opinions of those who do not want a political Europe. This difference of opinions is one of the rights to freedoms recognised by the Charter itself.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Charter's enemies highlight the political significance but also the legal status, which does not conflict with the Treaties but reinforces the democratic perspectives. For some the Charter does not go far enough and for others it goes too far. The Members of the European People's Party, which has Christian Democrat origins, are convinced that the reference to Europe's spiritual and moral heritage will strengthen the cohesion of a Union which values cultural and political differences. The method followed by a transparent, open convention and the work carried out by Mr Méndez de Vigo and other Members deserve our full support. Now we expect Nice to produce a strategy which will make Europe a union of economic, social and political rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the Commission would like to endorse the comments made by the President-in-Office, Mr Moscovici, and to welcome the key contribution made by the Members of the European Parliament to the debate and indeed to the Convention, particularly the role played by Mr Méndez de Vigo in the Praesidium of the Convention drafting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight the very important role played by President Herzog, who not only urged us to draft the Charter as if it were to become a binding text, an essential condition, but also had a crucial role to play in the political negotiations, enabling us to arrive at a consensus which, I believe, we can present to the citizens of Europe as a shared European vision regarding the role of fundamental rights in our shared venture to see the emergence of the European Union of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has already been said on the matter of the added value of this Charter. I should just like to stress two points which the Commission sees as essential. Firstly, the principle that rights are indivisible. The principle that political, economic and social rights are indivisible cannot be seen as a minor matter or a way of settling accounts with the past. Quite the opposite. The principle of the indivisibility of fundamental rights is a political compromise with regard to the future, especially at a time when some people think that untrammelled globalisation or the hegemony/dominance of the financial markets must be guaranteed by sacrificing citizens’ social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to state that this Charter is not a slave to any particular ideology. It is subject only to the key concept of the worth of the human being within the construction of Europe in the first place, and secondly to a certain vision of the social model, a social model in which solidarity and respect for fundamental rights are compatible with economic competitiveness at world level. This is no minor matter; it is a political Charter for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second added value, which is the principle that fundamental rights are universal. In this respect I should like to point out that here, for the first time, a European Union document is making it perfectly clear that the rights listed in the Charter are, for the most part, applicable to all individuals regardless of nationality or even right of residence. This is an important amalgamation at a time when the European Union is required to define the legal status, in terms of rights and duties, of third country nationals legally resident within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this Charter is just a beginning. I see it as a foundation stone providing a basis for social development, even insofar as its legal status is concerned. I think the objective of ensuring the indivisibility of fundamental rights is critical, and that the Council, the Commission and Parliament should make special efforts to publish and distribute the Charter among European citizens, but I am quite sure that, above and beyond the political instructional quality of the Charter, its legal impact is going to make itself felt, particularly with regard to the institutions proclaiming it. I am convinced that the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself will not be able to ignore the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when acting, in future, in a legislative or executive capacity. I am convinced, moreover, that the European Court of Justice will not be able to ignore the Charter either. In this respect I am disappointed to hear the criticisms of legal activism which have been made, as I, in fact, wonder whether the greatest incentive to activism is not specifically provided by Article 6(2) of the Treaty, which refers to the vague, abstract concept of the shared constitutional tradition of the fifteen Member States, instead of referring to a Charter containing 48 clear, readable articles.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you are aware that the Commission is of the opinion that the Convention has drawn up a text which is destined, sooner or later, to be incorporated into the Treaties. We might even describe the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties and recognition of its binding legal status as a two-step process. It is destined to be incorporated in to the Treaties and the Commission thinks this should be fully realised as part of the reorganisation of the treaties we proposed at the Intergovernmental Conference, which we hope the European Council will be able to approve in Nice. In the immediate future, however, it would be inconceivable if, on the very day on which the Heads of State and Government are to formally proclaim the Charter, they were to fail to make reference to it in Article 6(2) of the Treaties. I place my faith in the French Presidency’s commitment to obtaining as early as Nice a consensus which at least recognises the reference to the Charter as the inspiration for fundamental rights within the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moscovici,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could not possibly improve upon Antonio Vitorino’s speech, so I shall briefly speak to stress the quality of the debate in this House, which has no parallel except for the debate held within the Convention, and I should like to congratulate those Members of the European Parliament who participated in it, especially Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mrs Pervenche Berès. Listening to this debate, I am pleased to see what appears to be a clear majority in Parliament in favour of this text, even if there a number of you still have to be won over. Some find the text excessively binding, even too advanced in relation to a number of reforms which it would be liable to dismantle, while others find it devoid of content or not sufficiently binding. I deduce from this that, perhaps, the text is an accurate reflection of this Europe of ours, which progresses by means of compromises between diverse concepts, diverse nations, diverse traditions, and here I think Galileo’s expression might be used, “<span class="italic">Eppure si muove</span>” (and still it moves).</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer only to some of the salient points of this debate. Firstly, Mr Dupuis, quite frankly I do not believe that this is an empty text. I believe, on the contrary, as Mr Vitorino has said, that it reflects a shared vision of our European Union, giving it, as Mr Barón Crespo said, fundamental legitimacy and, personally, I am convinced that it is a major contribution towards meeting the expectations of our fellow citizens. They need meaning, they need values, and they need recognition of their rights. With all its imperfections and limitations, this text meets these needs. This is also true of the candidate countries, whose citizens are also hungry for rights and values. The Charter therefore, I am convinced, properly belongs to the political <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">You naturally raised the subject of the legal status of the Charter in the course of the debate. Let me assure you, as President-in-Office of the Council, that I have clearly receive your message, especially the message expressed very forcefully by Mr Barón Crespo. Let me repeat, however, that if we had from the outset insisted that the Charter must be binding, then the text would have been disappointing. It was a clear-cut choice between either a substantial text which was liable not to be binding in the short term or a text which perhaps had some chance of being binding in the short term but which would have lost any content. I further note that there appears to be no clear majority within the European Council in favour of granting it a binding status.</p>
<p class="contents">We are building a major political edifice, and every brick in the wall counts. I therefore believe that a reasonable approach would be to consolidate the foundation we have in this Charter and then to make ready for the next level. I have no doubt that it will come about in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has just mentioned the spirit in which the Charter was drawn up, with a view to its being made, one day, a binding text. Just like him, I am convinced, firstly, that it will have singular effects in the immediate short term and, secondly, that it will shortly become binding.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the method adopted, my feeling is that compromise has not served to lessen the power of the text and that it has, on the contrary, made it possible to bring out a certain unity and even unanimity regarding the values and rights we share.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the criticism that the citizens of Europe were not sufficiently involved in the process to be unfair in part. Never in the history of European construction has the principle of transparency been applied with such determination and with such success. Let me remind you that ETUC, for example, representing 60 million employees in Europe, was consulted, that several hundred NGOs were consulted, that citizens had the opportunity to simply submit their contributions and that some of their proposals were adopted by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I turn to the main aspect, the content of the Charter, in order to say that, in my view, the Charter’s content is truly significant – i.e. meaningful for the citizens – and ambitious. The Convention chose to include fundamental rights inspired by various texts of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and Member State constitutions. The human rights included in the Charter are powerful ones. I am thinking, for example, of the inviolability of human dignity, the right to life with the prohibition of the death penalty. These are modern propositions. The ethical issues and freedom-related issues connected to the new technologies and science are dealt with. I am thinking, for example, of the right to the integrity of the person, the protection of personal data, and, as Mrs Berès pointed out, it is my conviction that social rights must not be denigrated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter affirms the social values of European construction. It guarantees that the European Union respects and shall respect the implementation of these values within States. That will help to increase citizens’ confidence in the European Union. The Charter, furthermore, pays special attention to some of the more vulnerable categories of the population, such as the disabled, children or the aged. It also most forcefully affirms the equality of men and women in all areas, as well as the principle of non-discrimination. These rights are, I feel, expressed with unusual strength, and this is something on which the European Union can pride itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Charter adopts the founding principles of the European Union, highlighting the fundamental freedoms of the Community whilst emphasising the value of European citizenship. Here too, in specifying a right to good administration, the Charter means to be ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of this debate, I have heard a number of telling phrases: the Charter has been described as a bone thrown to keep the dog that is the European Parliament quiet, or indeed as a flimsy attempt to conceal the fights relinquished by a French Presidency that is on its last legs, seen especially in of the way in which it conducted the IGC. I shall not take the trouble to answer these harsh assessments, which I do not necessarily share and which, indeed, I hope to see proved wrong when we adopt the Nice Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I wanted to make in mentioning all this is that Nice is a vital stage. In particular I think we need to tie in Article 6, and also Article 7, and I am hopeful that we shall arrive at reforms on both these points. Nice is a vital stage, but it is not a finish line. It is, instead, a phase in the construction of Europe, and I believe that the Charter will be one of the major components of this phase, and I am delighted to see Parliament’s options on this score taking shape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
