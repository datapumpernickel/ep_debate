As the European Union, we face the United States on an equal footing. The same applies to the Asian states, and the developing countries play an important role as well. With almost a 40% share of trade and services, the European Union has become an important negotiating partner worldwide, which bears responsibility in all areas of the WTO and which should involve all the industrialised and developing countries in this process. We must do justice to this responsibility by making the European Parliament's voice heard at an early stage, and by being present to shape the focus of the current negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">So today, we want to fulfil this task and, with our recommendations on the WTO's Built-In Agenda, make our position clear to the citizens of Europe early on. We want these recommendations to be taken into account at the WTO's interim review in April 2001. Our individual demands are in line with our proposals at the multilateral round in Seattle. As that round failed to achieve a result, we now wish to clarify and update our position by putting forward these recommendations on agriculture, services, and specific intellectual property issues. Today's debate will not include the full range of issues such as environmental protection, health policy, competition, minimum social standards, etc. We will be clarifying our position on those areas in a series of further recommendations in a few months' time, but certainly before the new multilateral round opens in Qatar at the beginning of November. So I would ask my colleagues from the other interested committees to be patient until then. I would like to mention Mrs Flemming in particular, who has put forward some very interesting proposals. They will undoubtedly play a key role in the committee responsible, as well as in Parliament, during the next round.</p>
<p class="contents">This report on the Built-In Agenda is only intended to deal with the three areas, not the package as a whole. Let me pick out a few points. Firstly, regarding agriculture: as outlined in the Council's mandate of December 2000, we want to achieve a balance between trade and non-trade concerns in agriculture. For example, structural funding for rural development belongs in the <span class="italic">green box</span> and thus ceases to be the subject of wrangling within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the Commission's courageous proposal, which had our full support and which led to the Council of Ministers' recent decision to remove all trade barriers on all products from the world's 48 least developed countries. This is a signal for a close partnership with the developing countries within the WTO framework, a signal which does not diminish in value even in light of the transitional arrangements for ‘sensitive’ products. We also advocate, however, the vigorous defence of the existing European model of agriculture based on multifunctionality. The precise details are set out in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding services: we wish to achieve further progressive liberalisation of the trade in services. This must not be a one-way street for the industrialised nations, however, but must include the developing countries as well. As regards the protection of intellectual property, we want biodiversity to be respected, and we are also seeking a guarantee that in the field of plant innovations, the economic benefit will be shared appropriately between the donor country and the party wishing to commercialise the material.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeking greater transparency in the preparation and conduct of ministerial meetings. Procedures relating to composition and reporting mechanisms, and to the frequency and timing of formal WTO meetings, must be subordinate to this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of greater democratisation and improved scrutiny of the WTO mechanisms, we are calling for the speedy creation of a parliamentary dimension, in which the various regions of the world, and the parliaments and parliamentarians involved in the decision-making process in the field of trade, could discuss the reforms of the WTO and introduce and implement effective scrutiny of the WTO bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But never mind!</p>
<p class="contents">The first point to stress is that the negotiation of an agreement on trade in agricultural and food products only makes sense within a global agreement that also covers other sectors of the economy and other facets of society. The second point to stress is that the European Union must be willing to make an extra effort to reduce internal support in market access and export subsidies. For this effort, however, we must demand transparent rules and equivalent action from our trading partners. The third point is that it is considered essential that the peace clause and the special safeguard clause should be renewed in order to maintain stability in agricultural markets and farmers’ incomes. The fourth point has to do with the need to preserve the European agricultural model, characterised, as mentioned by Konrad Schwaiger, by the predominance of family businesses and the multifunctional role of agriculture in society. Yet we have to remember that we must preserve the primary function of agriculture, which is production. Otherwise, if we do not bear this in mind, our countryside will sooner or later become just an agricultural museum. Fifthly, it is important to highlight the initiative aimed at the less developed countries, but we must take steps to prevent this measure from being exploited by those not entitled to use it. As a final note, I should like to recall that the European Union is, today, the world’s largest importer of agricultural and food products, with a trade deficit of over USD 16 billion, and is, therefore, a net importer. The United States and all the members of the Cairns Group, on the other hand, are very much net exporters. In view of this situation, it is quite right that the European Union should be entitled to preserve its agricultural productive fabric, which is the basis for the economic vitality of its countryside. Falling into line over free trade, pure and simple, would not only mean yielding sheep-like to others’ strategic interests but, in time, it would also be a death sentence for our countryside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the new communications technologies, it is possible, with a click on the computer, to conclude contracts worldwide or enter into legal transactions within a very short period of time. So it is important, that in Europe, we give far more priority to the WTO negotiations in future, and discuss the fine detail to a greater extent as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Parliament has carried out very significant preparatory work in this area, but we should also give careful thought to the structure of our economy. In Europe at present, we have around 16 million SMEs with a workforce of less than 250 persons; these SMEs generate 60% of GNP and provide 60% of jobs. So the WTO negotiations are extremely important for SMEs in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that special priority should be given to the protection of intellectual property and the enforcement of protected rights. Here, a key task is to examine how we should define the level of inventiveness for patents, for example. Some countries require a very low level of inventiveness and, therefore, grant a great many patents very quickly. Other countries in Europe are very strict, and start off by making checks worldwide to establish whether the level of inventiveness is adequate. That is why it is necessary, in my view, to have this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, industrial applicability – which is also a condition of patentability – should quite obviously be discussed at the WTO negotiations as well, so that we can ensure that disputes in this area are avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the precautionary principle is very important for our future. It is also important, however, to make product safety a priority for SMEs, and ensure that with third-party certification, <span class="italic">de facto</span> exemption from liability can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seguro (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Pascal Lamy, I should like to congratulate Messrs Konrad Schwaiger and Arlindo Cunha on the reports and documents they have presented here, and also highlight the contributions made by all our colleagues in both the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress three points in this report that I believe are essential. Firstly, paragraph 22 on the question of services, calling for GATT agreements not to restrict the scope of the Member States to approve rules which recognise the specific nature of the provision of public services, particularly in the areas of education, health and culture. I see it as an essential anchor for the preservation of multiculturalism and the need to state that not everything can be liberalised, that liberalisation must firstly and ultimately serve the citizens, who are the ones who should benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point I should like to mention has to do with the protection of intellectual property, and particularly paragraph 28, which points to the limited scope of the negotiations on protection of intellectual property under the Built-In Agenda. This, of course, is directed at Commissioner Pascal Lamy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third essential point, already mentioned here by both Konrad Schwaiger and Arlindo Cunha, has to do with our safeguarding of the multifunctional role of agriculture. This aspect is fundamental not as a slogan, not as a way for us to overcome our weaknesses, but as a way for us to reconcile quantity and quality. Although what Arlindo Cunha said is true, that “the primary function of agriculture is production”, it is no less true that this production must be encouraged with quality in mind. And this new Built-In Agenda has appeared just as the climate and context in Europe is one of uncertainty and mistrust over the quality of certain products. Therefore, when we assert the multifunctional role of agriculture, we must recognise that this priority must also include the strictest public health measures as well as consumer protection and support. I believe this is an essential role that Parliament needs to highlight at this time. Since I know Commissioner Pascal Lamy’s positions on this, I am sure that this role will also be performed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out and, indeed, stress that there are other points to be included in this agenda that we must not forget, as the rapporteur said, but they will be part of the November 2001 round. They concern the social, environmental and defence aspects of a sustainable development model, so that what is globalised is not just wealth but also progress and economic and social development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – First, two questions addressed to the Commission. Paragraph 9 of the draft report talks about the need to preserve the peace clause and special safeguard clause for a provisional period. I am very curious to know what your views are on the preservation of those clauses as the talks proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, paragraph 22, which Mr Seguro just mentioned. I understand that GATS do not necessarily affect publicly controlled utilities. I was wondering if you could perhaps expand on what the implications of GATS might be on utilities which have already been privatised.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, two observations. Firstly, it seems to me that there is a unique opportunity for increasing common ground between the EU and the US as far as agriculture is concerned. This is principally because of the profligacy of the American Government in supporting American farmers to an ever greater degree over the last few years, in a sense removing the moral authority that the US has had in the past in accusing the common agricultural policy of being wasteful and distorting. I wonder if you really feel there is an opportunity for you and the US to find new common ground in the agriculture talks. Finally, you will not be surprised to hear that I wish to stress the importance of the latter part of paragraph 40.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nice Summit might have been a halting step forward in terms of efficiency, but it is a serious step backward in terms of legitimacy and transparency as far as the conduct of the EU's trade policy is concerned. This is notably exemplified by the way in which the 133 Committee continues to take important and highly political decisions in the trade field without any published records or public account. In view of the lacuna which has opened up after the somewhat pot-pourri result of Nice, I urge both the Commission and the Council to look very favourably at the idea of an Interinstitutional Agreement in this field. If not, the moral authority of the whole European Union on transparency and legitimacy is seriously weakened in the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it follows on from the great efforts made by the Directorate of the Commission to redefine our trade policy and to ensure that trade serves the objectives of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I have four comments to make. The first is that, while undertaking a new round of talks on the basis of a wider agenda is still more than ever a fine objective, the mandates granted by the Council cannot be said to be satisfactory as they stand. In this instance it is not a matter of bartering trade concessions in return for environmental or social clauses, but rather of taking a different tack in negotiating on trade in order to ensure that it is in better accord with the societal models and state regulation requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the talks scheduled in the Built-In Agenda are a test, which brings me to my second point. The agriculture line is not without its grey areas. There is, admittedly, an increased awareness that trade in agricultural products must be compatible with independence in terms of food supply, public health and land use, yet we are at a disadvantage due to the postponement of reform in the common agricultural policy until after 2006. Indeed, the report speaks of the need to safeguard the model, though it is more a case of the need to change the model. Regarding trade, while it is essential to reduce export subsidies, we reject the calls to bring them into line with world prices, as this is a blatantly productivist move.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the line on services is not satisfactory. There is talk of ‘further progressive liberalisation’. That is a unilateral objective. The Commission, moreover, states that trade policy is not a goal in itself, but it must help support the social model. Yet, in our social model there are services of general interest, and in developing countries such general interest services have yet to be formed.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall, therefore, endorse the development of trade compatible with, or contributing to, the promotion of services of general interest. The European Union wishes to keep some sectors, such as, education and culture outside the domain of free trade. That is not enough. We have to work in the context of universal public assets. Indeed, it would be marvellous if the Directorate could provide us with a communication on the ways in which free trade and services of general interest may be complementary and compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one last point I should like to raise on a major problem of governance. We must work with civil society as we do with the developing countries and allow a frank exchange of views. This is something the Directorate does, but not the States, and Parliament is lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the responsibility of every single one of us. This is an approach that is critical in ensuring the success of the organisation of world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, the Commission last year committed itself to improving the position of the developing countries. Improved market access for the least developed countries is a case in point. The General Affairs Council, which was held at the end of February, also pointed along the same lines. The long transitional periods, however, for bananas, sugar and rice are most regrettable. Given the significance of their agricultural sector, market access for developing countries is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">High EU standards, with regard to the environment and health, should not embrace protectionism <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the developing world. Restricted market access is only appropriate for products which constitute a threat to health or the environment. The European requirements must be accompanied by assistance in meeting these standards, such as technology for environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes. As price competition is increasing, we need to shift our agricultural support measures from price intervention to direct income and investment support.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, the free exchange of services also impacts on the developing countries. Are their fragile economies given the opportunity to prepare for competition? Without a sensible policy, they will be overrun by wealthy and specialist service providers before they know it.</p>
<p class="contents">Decision making in the WTO must give the developing world the chance to offer a counterweight to the interests of the rich trading blocs. After all, justice requires policy as well as the useful instrument of free trade. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation of the sound work done by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Schwaiger’s report on the negotiations conducted within the WTO framework on the Built-In Agenda, in our view, raises three questions to which, I hope, our debate is going to provide answers.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, surely it is dangerous to negotiate separately on the Built-In Agenda? Admittedly, the negotiations on agriculture, services and certain aspects of intellectual property, as they are termed in the Built-In Agenda, were already programmed by the Uruguay Round and may, therefore, be considered as not having been legally affected by the failure of the general negotiations in Seattle. It seems to have been implicitly accepted that discussions on these areas will continue separately, but is that actually reasonable, given that all these subjects are effectively interdependent? Moreover, as I understood it, the European Union’s previous position has always been that there should be nothing but comprehensive negotiation. Should the failure at Seattle not lead us to rethink the entire emphasis of negotiations?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is as follows: Paragraph 1 of the motion for a resolution we have before us calls on the Commission to conduct the negotiations on the Built-In Agenda on the basis of the guidelines given by the Council from before Seattle. Yet is the situation really still the same? There have been great strides forward in public opinion regarding the regulation of international trade. The failure of Seattle was an initial indicator of this, but opinion has developed apace since then, particularly under the impetus of a number of agricultural crises. Admittedly, the 1999 negotiating mandate already took into consideration the requirement for a multifunctional agriculture and an agricultural policy incorporating concerns unrelated to trade. At the same time, however, it expressed the necessity of pursuing the liberalisation of trade as a priority. Is that still compatible with developments? Do we not need further deliberation on the subject?</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, I am struck to note that, among the new concerns to be taken into account, people always cite product safety, environmental protection, food quality, animal welfare, justifiably so, but never independence in terms of food supply. Yet, Europe’s self-sufficiency in terms of food is absolutely crucial, and is very closely associated with all the other objectives we deem necessary. This has been demonstrated by means of a negative example of our dependence in terms of vegetable proteins, which we unfortunately had to accept at Blair House and which has led us to overuse animal meal. In the light of these events, do you not consider that the Blair House agreements need to be renegotiated?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question is this: How are the future talks to be monitored by the Council and the interested Parliaments? This point was clarified in some of the drafts for the Treaty of Nice by, either, a rewording of Article 133, or, a new protocol stipulating very precisely how the Council should supervise the Commission during the WTO negotiations to ensure that it does not deviate from the common position. All these excellent provisions, however, have disappeared from the final version. Similarly notable by their absence are any provisions on parliamentary scrutiny. Hence our proposal – I am coming to my conclusion, Mr President – before opening further negotiations, should we not first reopen the issue of increasing our control of the negotiators? We think this an essential precondition in order to properly safeguard the interests of the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it is the task of the European Parliament, in particular, to instil confidence in the positive and sustainable nature of the WTO process. On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, therefore, I greatly welcome the fact that Mr Schwaiger's report has again included safeguarding cultural diversity in the catalogue of demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective must be to explain to people, in credible, informed and comprehensible terms, that this process to which we are committed has the vision to achieve four goals on the basis of sustainable development: lasting economic growth for all, the protection of our environment, compliance with appropriate social standards and the preservation of cultural diversity. As the European Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, we should continue to promote this approach beyond the Union's borders as well.

Firstly, as you will see from the additional amendments which have now been proposed for this week, there is a great deal of interest in this issue within the House, and this interest generally tends to focus on a small number of themes. So my first question is this: are the TRIPs negotiations really all that promising? Should they continue as before, or is it time for a review? Should more be done in the field of agriculture? How can effective consumer protection be safeguarded? There are many other questions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask you about the Built-In Agenda, which is now being negotiated and which is due for review in March. How great, in reality, are the differences between the parties negotiating on the Built-In Agenda? What impact is the agricultural crisis in Europe having on these negotiations, and how far have the negotiations progressed overall? Or is it more a question of business as usual? Are we simply carrying on as if nothing has happened?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I should like to raise is this, you have produced a document which indicates that you would like to see greater flexibility in the forthcoming WTO negotiations. Flexibility is a very broad term. I greatly welcomed this document but I am sure that it will spark off many political discussions in this House as well. You can interpret it in any number of ways, so let me put a few questions to you. Does this document signal a move away from the European Union's previous strategy, which, until now, has been based on the principle that we have always had, and wanted to have, a comprehensive role, which has included competition and investment, for example, but also all the ‘soft’ issues such as social standards, labour standards, and progress on environmental issues? Does this document signal a move away from that? Does it mean that you will need a new negotiating mandate or is the old one enough? What impact will this have on cooperation with the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I am most grateful to Mr Clegg for pointing out, yet again, that Article 133 is not acceptable to us in its current form. This is nothing new to you, and we are on the same side here, but the Council is listening, and perhaps the Council will be prepared, one day, to introduce an amendment with us.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to make is as follows: you met Mr Bob Soellig in the United States. I gather from the press that the mood of the meeting was very good, which is not surprising given that you are old friends, so in that sense I hope we can look forward to a rosier future in transatlantic relations. What are your specific expectations, however, of these good relations with regard to the fresh negotiations taking place within the WTO framework? Will there be positive signals, and will these positive signals mean that in June or July we will have a negotiating strategy which will take us to Qatar? And will this negotiating strategy include the developing countries as well? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There must be no trade-off of concessions in the agricultural sector in exchange for concessions in other negotiating areas. This is necessary in order to safeguard the continued existence of the small-scale agricultural landscape, rural employment, environmental and resource protection, and modulated agricultural programmes, and to protect them from the impact of global market liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting and guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection in the EU makes substantial demands on agriculture in particular, and is the main prerequisite for fair trade in agricultural products without border controls. Over recent decades, the European food industry has benefited considerably from global market development, especially as regards the processing of agricultural products with high, or the highest, value added.</p>
<p class="contents">As the second-largest exporter of agricultural products, and by far the largest exporter of processed food, the European Union, therefore, has a significant interest in a well-functioning system of global trade. What is important for the negotiations is to ensure that the actors from sustainable agriculture are not played off against one other, and that this form of agriculture is harmonised. The issues of food safety and rural employment, consumer protection and the environment, as well as the sparing use of all resources, are viewed in different ways by the various actors, who also afford them different political priority. At the same time, the WTO should be focusing on issues which are moving up the public agenda. They include health, the environment, and social affairs, and not just as three separate issues.</p>

I am a passionate supporter of the WTO, as he is, because I believe that it offers poor countries the opportunity to integrate with wealthy nations. As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I am also most grateful to Mr Schwaiger for taking the view that consumer protection, animal welfare and health are very important issues which we will deal with as priorities at a later date. If we fail to do so, we can expect to witness situations such as the Seattle débâcle time and time again.</p>
<p class="contents">In advance of this debate, however, I should like to raise two specific issues. I think that it is appalling for the WTO to impose or consider imposing sanctions on the European Union simply because the European Union is trying to protect its citizens from hormone-treated meat. We now have scientific proof that one hormone in particular is carcinogenic, while there is a strong possibility that a further five are also carcinogens. The precautionary principle must apply to the WTO as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the European Union, a number of states – notably Great Britain and Austria – have banned animal testing of cosmetics. The majority of citizens and consumers in the EU want to see this ban extended throughout the European Union. I think that the WTO will have to accept that it is possible to be very successful economically yet remain sensitive to the pain and suffering of God's creatures – animals – and that we must respect animals as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They made it clear that they did not feel that their concerns about the implementation of the Uruguay Round had been met and therefore they were not prepared to go any further. They were insisting, as they continue to do – as you know, Commissioner – on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need in this Parliament to be much more aware of the need to monitor international obligations, in particular since no reference has been made here today to the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement and its agricultural trade protocols. The EU must be much more sensitive to these concerns than it has been in the past, though I pay tribute to the Commissioner, especially as regards access to markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I want to touch briefly on the rather shadowy side of globalisation which is typified for me by access to medicines and the clear need for a review of TRIPs. Eleven million people will die of preventable diseases this year. In Zambia, treatment of one member of a family for pneumonia will take up the family's entire monthly budget. This is of deep concern. As you are aware, the pharmaceutical companies have taken the South African Government to court about its Medicines Act of 1997. This act would allow parallel importing and would authorise the genetic production of patented medicines for the government's non-profit, non-commercial use. Four million people are HIV-infected in that country and the South African Government believes it has a constitutional duty to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the Commissioner agree with me that the TRIPs is neutral on parallel imports and actually allows for compulsory licensing? And would he agree with me that there should be a reduction in patent protection, reinforced health safeguards and a ban on the threatened use of trade sanctions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to agriculture too, although it includes certain changes made by the Committee on Agriculture specifically to ensure food safety and food quality, it does not take into account other major amendments, such as the one we tabled on the review of the Blair House agreement, with particular regard to protein-rich plants, given the BSE crisis and the part played by animal meal. It also ultimately advocates the continuation of the trend to liberalise agricultural trade, which we do not support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unlike a captain of industry, the farmer cannot simply decide to relocate his means of production to wherever the manufacturing conditions are most favourable: where the wages are low, the sun always shines, and there is enough rainfall. So different rules must apply to agriculture, and food safety and food security – in other words, food sovereignty – must be the first commandment for every individual state.</p>
<p class="contents">The multifunctionality of agriculture must also be recognised and enforced by the World Trade Organisation, and that means that agricultural funding must be based on ecological and social criteria as well. The task is not, and I must make this quite clear, to engage in new forms of agricultural protectionism targeted especially at developing and threshold countries. Again, they must be looked at separately in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">It also means, however, that the European Union cannot dump its many surpluses with high export subsidies at global market prices in order to disrupt or even destroy markets elsewhere. There are countless examples of this. And one thing is clear; at the prices shaped by the global market, no one can possibly produce agricultural products under socially and ecologically compatible conditions and still make a profit. That is amply demonstrated by the current agricultural crisis which we are witnessing here in the European Union. We must, therefore, focus primarily on the European internal market, and those who wish to produce for the global market should do so, of course, but they should do so without subsidies and support from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing must be clear: food safety and consumer protection must have absolute priority. There is one basic rule which we must not ignore: people everywhere in the world need healthy food, drinking water and air to breathe. Unless we have these three basic elements of life, everything else is irrelevant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to briefly mention one issue which you may be able to respond to directly. What is the situation with regard to the operating agreement? Even if it is not yet in force, it is clear that it is potentially explosive, especially for the future of all that we have been discussing. Is a review planned, and what form can and will this take? That is my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">The second really follows on from everything we have been discussing here. My main concern is how acceptance of the negotiating process can be achieved in light of the current overall political situation. What is the Commission planning to do? What are the options for the European Union? There is a great deal of cause for concern. The WTO is what it is. But what it lacks, above all – especially in terms of achieving acceptance – is transparency in almost every policy area. The demands which we have put forward in paragraphs 30 to 40 of the report point in the right direction. As ever, all that is lacking is the will to implement them. This lack of transparency leads to a great many overly-dramatic, interest-led articles in the press, such as the one I read at the weekend in the Financial Times, which attacks the WTO's public image. Of course, the venue for the WTO Round – or the Ministerial meeting first of all – is not the best choice in terms of image. What does the Commission think it can do, in terms of a general information campaign, to bring about change? And are you considering more specific initiatives to enable developing countries to participate in the decision-making process, e.g. by covering their legal costs and taking other similar measures which could be arranged on a bilateral basis? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should first like to sincerely thank Mr Schwaiger and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for this excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">It provides valuable support for the positions adopted by the European Union and, indeed as Mrs Mann did, I was pleased to note that it had aroused great interest among the Members of Parliament, judging at least by the number of amendments that have been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the considerations and concerns you express in this report are broadly in line with those of the Commission which, of course, as some of you have said, go beyond the scope of the Built-In Agenda which is our current objective in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Like us, you seek to set up a framework for the liberalisation of trade in the form of a set of mutually accepted multilateral regulations, you wish to increase the transparency of WTO negotiation procedures, you wish to improve the integration of developing countries into the multilateral system, you wish to safeguard European models in agriculture and public health, and likewise in the fields of the environment and public services. This is basically a summary of the European Union agenda for the first round of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always considered that progress on the Built-In Agenda, the subject of your report, would be facilitated by being incorporated in a wider agenda. Your report basically highlights the same argument and, in making this point, I am responding to Mr Berthu’s comment. We are making very slow progress in Geneva in what are really the preparations for talks on agriculture and services, while we know full well that only a comprehensive round will really be able to catalyse any relaunch. That is the stage we are at today.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall endeavour to comment briefly on the matters you raised in your report, particularly on agriculture, services and intellectual property, which were often brought up in the speeches I have just heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning agriculture, we agree with you. Firstly, I confirm that the European Union’s negotiating position is indeed shaped by Agenda 2000. Secondly, the needs of developing countries are top of our list of concerns in agricultural matters, and this, indeed, was the objective of the ‘everything but arms’ initiative which I must thank you for supporting. Thirdly, you wish to safeguard the European farm model, considering the many roles it plays in social, environmental and food-related matters, and this meets with the full agreement of Franz Fischler and myself. Let me reassure Messrs Seguro and Cunha on this point, the promotion of considerations in agriculture unrelated to trade and the safeguarding of our own farm model continue to be key components of our negotiation objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the precautionary principle which you have just stressed, I think it is clear that BSE and, more recently, foot-and-mouth disease inevitably raise questions of this kind. Do we have the multilateral framework needed to deal with these questions? At the international level, we feel that the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures is appropriate as it stands and does not therefore need to be renegotiated as such. The Commission, however, like the Council, shares the wish expressed again by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler to look into the precautionary approach in this sector. We have presented proposals in this respect and we shall continue to debate the issue in the multilateral negotiations. That is part of our agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">To my last point on agriculture, in answer to Mr Clegg, there is indeed a ‘peace clause’ or, to be more precise, a non-aggression clause, which exempts the field of agriculture from disputes on subsidies until the end of 2003. We think this non-aggression pact is beneficial to all parties and that is something that all parties should bear in mind when this issue is raised next time, that is, at the end of 2003. The ‘peace clause’ is not a Damocles’ sword hanging over the head of Europe alone. If indeed it is a Damocles’ sword, then it is also threatening the other heads around the negotiating table in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position on services is, briefly, as follows. Firstly, in our position at the head of the league of service exporters and importers in the world, we have conflicting commercial interests. Secondly, we wish to take development issues into consideration. Thirdly, and this answers Mr Herzog and Mrs Fiebiger, we are fully aware of the effects upon government policy of negotiations on services and we therefore agree absolutely with your recommendation as to the special nature of public service provision. The agreements already signed or yet to be signed under GATS, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, do not commit European States to a policy of privatisation or deregulation. In the sectors related to government and to public services of health, education and culture, we must and we shall therefore safeguard our legislative prerogatives, our social and cultural identity and our high levels of consumer safety and protection.</p>
<p class="contents">On intellectual property, let me stress one point that Mrs Kinnock raised and which is highlighted in a topical court case in South Africa, where the pharmaceutical industry is in conflict with the South African Government. I shall not comment on the case in question, since it is <span class="italic">sub judice</span> and it is not customary for the Commission to comment on such cases, but I would like to give you a clear explanation of the Commission’s policy on the issue of transmissible diseases affecting developing countries. This is a matter that was referred to us last summer.</p>
<p class="contents">A high-level international Round Table on the subject was held in Brussels in September 2000. The Round Table recommended a global approach based on three aspects, firstly, stepping up support from development policy, secondly, reducing the price of essential medicines, and thirdly, resuming high level research into such treatment. Following close on the heels of this Round Table, which brought together developing world governments, international organisations and the Member States, as well as a number of non-governmental organisations, we have just adopted a specific action programme based on this approach. Indeed I believe we are starting to see the first practical effects of this, with several pharmaceutical companies making commitments to reduce prices.</p>
<p class="contents">What role does intellectual property have to play in this context? In our opinion, it has an essential role in stimulating innovation and research. This is clearly stated in the GATT TRIPs agreement, but we should say just as clearly, Mrs Kinnock, that there are cases where exemptions to patent law are permitted and are authorised under the TRIPs Agreement. It is termed ‘compulsory licensing’ and is authorised in cases where exceptions are justified on public health grounds or in a health emergency. The agreement permits, and makes provision for, such flexibility and our position on this continues to be what I have been stating in public for several weeks –<span class="bold"> </span>all the agreement and nothing but the agreement. It is true that there is, as yet, no real international consensus on a balanced interpretation of these provisions but we have undertaken to promote this clear position: intellectual property is to be protected but exemptions must be maintained and applied where stipulated, both in the WTO, WIPO and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall answer Mrs Mann very quickly, though this may take me slightly over my allotted five minutes. We have indeed started to readjust our pre-Seattle mandate in the light of the concerns expressed by a number of developing countries. At this stage we do not need any official amendment to that mandate. We shall return to that matter when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to her question on the United States, it is true that I spent part of last week in the States. I return with a generally favourable impression of the administration, but one point is clear, and I must remind the House of this: US trade policy depends more on Congress than on the administration.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me straight to the institutional aspect of your report. We agree that the parliaments should be involved to a greater extent in the WTO debates. In terms of our internal procedures, we have, as you know, lost the ‘Battle of Nice’, which, to tell the truth, we were the only ones waging and, hence, we have to go back to the spirit of the framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission which we adopted in July 2000. I think that this framework agreement contains all we need to organise cooperation between our institutions and if we have a few outstanding problems on the settlement of disputes, then I am perfectly willing to discuss this question, if it is understood, however, that the settlement of disputes is not negotiation nor the establishment of internal legislation, but an executive prerogative. So, while I am happy to discuss and to provide information, none of us should confuse the management and settlement of disputes with legislative prerogatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the next phase before us is the Conference of Ministers in Qatar, from 9 to 13 November, this year. It goes without saying that, in the intervening period, we shall continue to work relentlessly with the competent parliamentary committee on the agenda and the progress that we are able to make.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that now is the time to consider the practical arrangements for taking part in the Qatar Conference. My intention is to adhere to the practice we established for Seattle in terms of the membership of your own delegation, and in Qatar I shall be counting on the active participation of some of the Members of this House in promoting what appear to be, according to this report, our common objectives.</p>
