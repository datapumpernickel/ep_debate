<p class="contents">Question No 18 by <span class="bold">María Sornosa Martínez </span>(H−0150/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Discrimination against an official at the Council on grounds of sexual orientation</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of First Instance recently upheld a Council decision refusing to place stable relationships between same‐sex couples on an equal footing with those between married couples, thereby rejecting the request made to this effect by a Swedish official working at the Council. The judgment by the Court thus fails to take account either of the 1998 amendment to the Council staff regulations, which guarantees equal treatment, or of Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union, which refers to combating discrimination based on sexual orientation. Furthermore, the judgment serves as confirmation of the persistent discrimination encountered by gays and lesbians, a fact which runs counter to the intended spirit of the Treaty on European Union, of which the Council and Commission are supposedly the guardians.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council intend to revise its decision to refuse the official concerned the benefits to which married couples are entitled, in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty and of its own staff regulations?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In a judgment of 28 January 1999, in case T−264/97, the Court of First Instance of the European Communities upheld a Council decision in a case concerning the interpretation of the concepts of ‘spouse" and ‘marriage" in the Community"s Staff Regulations. The Staff Regulations give married officials a number of financial rights (for example a household allowance and reimbursement of a spouse"s travelling expenses when taking up a post).</p>
<p class="contents">The applicant in this case had a ‘registered partnership" with a person of the same sex in accordance with Swedish law. He had asked his Community employer, the Council, to give an interpretation of the Staff Regulations classifying this registered partnership as equivalent to a marriage within the meaning of the Regulations. The Council had refused to do so, essentially arguing that this was not possible via a simple interpretation of the Staff Regulations but would require a modification of the Regulations. A decision would therefore have to be taken by the Community legislator on the basis of a Commission proposal and following consultation of the European Parliament and other interested institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court found that the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations ‘<span class="italic">contain Community concepts of ‘marriage’ and ‘spouse’ that refer exclusively to a relationship based on civil marriage in the traditional sense of the word</span> " (paragraph 26 of the judgment), a view also taken by the European Court of Human Rights; that the Council, in its capacity as employer, ‘<span class="italic">was under no obligation to consider the applicant"s registered partnership as a marriage within the meaning of the Staff Regulations</span> " (paragraph 30); and that the Council was not guilty of inadmissible discrimination (paragraph 33).</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as the honourable Member states, that the Court"s judgment failed to take account of Article 1a, recently added to the Staff Regulations, according to which ‘<span class="italic">officials have the right, in the application of the Regulations, to equal treatment without direct or indirect reference to race, to political, philosophical or religious convictions, or to gender or sexual orientation, without prejudice to the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations calling for a particular civil status</span> ". However, the Council draws the attention of the honourable Member to the words ‘<span class="italic">without prejudice to the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations calling for a particular civil status</span> ", which refer specifically to the provisions of the Staff Regulations which determine the granting of certain rights where a marriage exists, a concept which has already been interpreted by the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the discussion on Article 1a, the Council examined the possibility of classifying a registered partnership as equivalent to a marriage in the Staff Regulations. In a statement noted in its Minutes, it called on the Commission to ‘<span class="italic">undertake the necessary studies concerning [...] the recognition of registered partnerships and, on the basis of those studies, to submit to it any appropriate proposals in these areas</span> ". This fact was also noted by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 31 of its judgment. The Court added that it would be up to the Council, ‘<span class="italic">in its capacity as legislator, to amend the Regulations where necessary to allow officials who are in future in the position of this applicant to claim the household allowance on behalf of their partner</span> ".</p>
<p class="contents">To the Council"s knowledge, this study is still being carried out by the Commission services and no proposal has to date been made to the Council on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future Article 13 of the EC Treaty, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, any action taken by the Council here will also depend on presentation of a proposal by the Commission and on consultation with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has therefore taken action to deal with this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 19 by <span class="bold">Graham Watson </span>(H−0158/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Regional airports</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware that the potential open commercial trading by airlines of slots at airports will lead to smaller regional services being squeezed out of major hub airports because of purely commercial pressures?</p>
<p class="contents">Given the difficulties UK regional airports already have in securing slots at hubs such as Frankfurt Airport, is this not contrary to the policy of regionalisation and transport access by air on a region‐to‐region basis?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council attaches great importance to the question of slot allocation at Community airports and Council Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 of 8 January 1993 establishes the principles governing such allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, this Regulation does not accept slots trading and its principles have not been changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Council Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 makes special provisions, under limited circumstances, for the maintenance of adequate domestic air services to regions within a Member State but does not specifically contemplate the case of a route between a regional airport and a hub; such routes are subject to the general rule.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will consider any related proposals in due course, should specific Community action be deemed necessary to secure services between a regional airport and a hub. However, at this stage, there are no formal proposals from the Commission on this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 20 by <span class="bold">Marianne Eriksson </span>(H−0166/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Israel and the Non‐Proliferation Treaty</p>
<p class="contents">What action does the Council propose to take to persuade the State of Israel to sign the Treaty on the Non‐Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Union considers that the Treaty on the Non‐Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the cornerstone of the international non‐proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. The EU consistently stresses at every occasion that it attaches the utmost importance to universal adherence to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the Joint Action adopted in the run‐up to the NPT 1995 Review and Extension Conference, the EU carried out demarches to a large number of countries comprising, in addition to the then 172 States Parties, some other countries including Israel, to urge support for the indefinite extension of the NPT.</p>
<p class="contents">Also within the framework of its political dialogue with countries in the Middle East, the Union has repeatedly stated its commitment to promoting the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and called upon all countries not yet parties to the relevant treaties to adhere to them as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing for the second session of the NPT Preparatory Committee in 1998 the Council defined a common position on 23 April 1998, setting the EU objectives with a view to the successful outcome of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. The common position expressly provides for the possibility to carry out demarches to promote e.g. universal accession to the NPT.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council remains firmly committed to the successful outcome of the 2000 Review Conference. The Council will continue to promote universal accession to the Treaty and an active and constructive EU role in the strengthened review process and will act accordingly in the preparations for the forthcoming third Preparatory Committee to be held this spring. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 21 by <span class="bold">Anne McIntosh </span>(H−0171/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The millennium bug</p>
<p class="contents">Is the President‐in‐Office aware that insurance cover will not be provided for certain forms of transport, including air, sea and rail transport, on 1 January 2000?</p>
<p class="contents">What action does the President‐in‐Office intend to take to ensure both safe travel on 1 January 2000 and comprehensive insurance cover for foreseen and unforeseen liabilities?</p>
<p class="contents">What action does the President‐in‐Office intend to take to ensure safe travel on 1 January 2000?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">1. The Council is fully aware of the problems relating to the inability of many computer systems and programmes to cope with the century date change and of their implications for certain sensitive infrastructures and sectors such as transport. The honourable Member can rest assured that the Council attaches the utmost importance to matters regarding transport safety.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The Council is also aware that it is normal for insurances mainly to cover damage which results from unexpected events. Accordingly due to the foreseeable nature of the Year 2000 computer problem, the related insurance cover may not be exhaustive, and in order to secure the widest possible cover the businesses concerned must first do their utmost to make their systems Year 2000 compatible. It is up to the insurance policy holders and insurers to clarify bilaterally the details of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The Council recognises that the problem is global in nature and that the responsibility for solving it clearly lies with the suppliers and users of computer based systems. Nevertheless, governments must recognise that their citizens expect them to ensure their own infrastructures will continue to operate normally.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Council is aware that the players in the transport sector in particular are making huge efforts to render all their systems Year 2000 compatible in order to ensure safe travel on 1 January 2000 and around that date.</p>
<p class="contents">4. The Council would remind the honourable Member that the Council has on various occasions, including at the European Councils of Cardiff on 15 and 16 June 1998 and of Vienna on 11 and 12 December 1998, debated this important matter, which could have serious consequences for the safety of the European citizens and for the functioning of the internal market. The Council has concluded that in order to minimise potentially adverse consequences all actors concerned must cooperate within their sphere of responsibility and scope for action.</p>
<p class="contents">5. Owing to the fact that solving the problem mostly falls within the competence of the Member States and of the organisations concerned, there are no legislative proposals from the Commission to the Council regarding this issue. However, in this context the Commission has an important role to play in facilitating the exchange of best practices among the Member States, in raising awareness of the problem among industry and users, in particular SMEs, and in encouraging them to take action. The Council welcomes the Commission communications and other activities to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">6. As regards further action on this problem, the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that this issue continues to receive top priority and that the Council Working Party on Telecommunications has been accordingly mandated to meet in a mixed composition with experts from the relevant sectors, including transport, to examine where further Community coordination is necessary. Based on the findings by this group, the next extensive discussion will take place at a forthcoming meeting of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 22 by <span class="bold">Hugh McMahon </span>(H−0173/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Foreign language lettori working in Italian universities</p>
<p class="contents">Given the priority which the German Presidency has placed on education, the mutual recognition of qualifications and the necessity to enforce freedom of movement for citizens throughout the EU, what steps does the Presidency propose to take to ensure that universities in Italy comply with the rulings of the European Court of Justice (Case 33/88 of 30 May 1989 and Joined Cases C−259/91, C−332/91 of 2 August 1993) on the rights of foreign language lettori working in Italy?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency of the Council of the EU attaches great importance to the respect of Community law in the field of mutual recognition of qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">With specific reference to the question raised, it would recall that as a consequence of the rulings of the Court of Justice, foreign language lettori working in Italian universities may now sign open‐ended contracts. As far as those lettori who fall under the old system are concerned, the Presidency understands that this matter is being actively pursued between the Commission and the Italian Government. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 23 by <span class="bold">Mark Killilea </span>(H−0176/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Promotion of Equal Opportunities</p>
<p class="contents">In its document setting out its objectives and priorities for the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, one of the stated aims is the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women. Could the Council therefore comment on the fact that next month the Commission is closing down the Technical Assistance office which implements the Fourth Action Programme for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council attaches great importance to promoting equal opportunities between women and men. Moreover, it has recently adopted a number of texts dealing with this matter (see Annex I – list of texts adopted).</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, the Council welcomes the incorporation into the new Treaty of fresh provisions concerning measures to combat discrimination (Article 13) and the mainstreaming of equal opportunities (Article 2) and takes the view that such provisions will give fresh impetus to efforts to resolve this problem by encouraging the Commission to draw up new proposals for relevant legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a series of informal meetings of the ministers responsible for women's rights has been held. On 5 and 6 May 1998 an informal meeting of the ministers responsible for women's rights was held in Belfast on the topic of integration into working life and the importance of child‐care facilities. On 8 July 1998 an informal meeting of the ministers responsible for employment and equal opportunities was held in Innsbruck on the topic of women's employment. The latter meeting gave rise to interesting exchanges of views on the equal opportunities dimension to the employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also takes the view that the action programmes on equal opportunities between women and men play an important role in promoting equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council is not in a position to comment on the internal organisational decisions taken by the Commission in connection with the implementation of such programmes, such as that to which the honourable Member refers in his question. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 24 by <span class="bold">Gerard Collins </span>(H−0182/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Energy taxation</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lafontaine has recently stated that he would try to secure progress at a European level on so‐called ‘eco‐tax'. Could the Council clarify what steps it will be taking in the coming months to deal with this issue and what it defines as ‘progress'. In other words what is the final goal of the Presidency regarding energy taxation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The continuation of the discussions on the Commission proposal for the taxation of energy products is one of the priorities in the Presidency working programme for the first half of 1999. According to the commitment by the ECOFIN Council which was reaffirmed by the Vienna European Council, the competent Working Party is studying, at present, the problems raised by the proposal and possible solutions which might help to overcome these problems. To that aim, the group studies in particular the economic effects of the proposed measures and takes also into account their implications for the environment. A first report which takes stock of the Group's work will be presented to the ECOFIN Council in March. The Presidency expects that the discussions in the Council will give sufficient guidance needed for a further examination of the proposal by the relevant Working Party. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 25 by <span class="bold">Olivier Dupuis </span>(H−0185/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: European corps</p>
<p class="contents">The humanitarian crises, the acts of military aggression and the conflicts which have occurred over the last few years both in Europe and in the rest of the world have highlighted the Union's structural inability to respond to such situations other than from the purely humanitarian point of view on account of its lack of a proper common foreign and defence policy and of common instruments which would enable such a policy to be implemented. In recent months we have witnessed a proliferation of statements and positions expressed by Europe's political leaders concerning the need for a common European defence and security system to be set up. Does the Council not consider that, in such a context, the establishment, on a non‐national basis, of a 100 000‐strong European corps of men and women, including military and civilian units and responsible, in accordance with a decision by Parliament and the Council and under the authority of a Commission Vice‐President, for carrying out peacemaking, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, would enable the Union to intervene more effectively in crisis situations and could represent a practical step towards developing a common foreign and security policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not discussed the concept of a ‘European corps" which the honourable Member refers to. As the honourable Member knows, in the current institutional framework the establishment of a ‘European" military corps made up of national contingents is actually a matter for the Western European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union"s desire to intervene effectively in crises has given rise to a new debate on European security and defence issues. A central element of this is the need to provide the European Union with a credible and effective military capacity which will allow it to implement crisis management tasks (’St Petersburg tasks") and thus to strengthen its common foreign and security policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 26 by <span class="bold">Niall Andrews </span>(H−0186/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The EU and non‐governmental organisations</p>
<p class="contents">Non‐governmental organisations make a significant contribution to Irish society whether in Dublin or elsewhere in Ireland and also to society throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the President‐in‐Office outline what special initiatives it intends to provide at EU level aimed at supporting and encouraging the role of non‐governmental organisations?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">1. As regards the work of non‐governmental organisations at EU level, the Council draws attention to the conference on a European employment policy to assist the disabled which was held in Dresden on 24 and 25 February 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the next few months the Council intends to adopt a resolution setting out the broad lines of a European employment policy to assist the disabled. Admittedly, this is only one aspect of the very varied work which non‐governmental organisations carry out in the social sphere at EU level. However, if the honourable Member wishes to learn more about the real support which the Community gives to non‐governmental organisations on the ground, he might usefully address his question to the Commission, which is doubtless in a better position than the Council to supply him with reliable and up‐to‐date information. In that case, I should be delighted to provide him with the name and address of the person responsible for social security and social integration in the Commission's DG V.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can inform the honourable Member that the Commission is preparing to submit new proposals based on Articles 13 and 137 in the context of the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">2. As regards measures to encourage the work of non‐governmental organisations in the development aid sphere, the German Presidency has already organised or intends to organise: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ a round table, involving non‐governmental organisations which deal with population and health issues in the developing countries, on the topic ‘The role of civil society in the implementation of the Cairo action programme'. This round table was held in Brussels on 21 and 22 January 1999, organised jointly by the German Presidency and the Commission; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ an informal seminar in Berlin, on 18 March 1999, on the role of NGOs in fostering the development of civil society in the developing countries, to be attended by the EU development aid ministers, the Commissioners responsible and a platform of NGOs; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ as under other Presidencies, a meeting with the NGOs' Liaison Committee to provide a forum for an exchange of views prior to the meeting of the ‘Development' Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 27 by <span class="bold">Bernd Posselt </span>(H−0187/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Developments in Slovakia</p>
<p class="contents">What lessons does the German Presidency of the Council draw from the positive developments in Slovakia and does that country have a chance of moving up into the front rank of applicant countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary elections in Slovakia on 25‐26 September 1998 were free and fair. The European Union welcomed this new development which bodes well for the integration of Slovakia into the Union"s structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council noted at its meeting of 7 December 1998 that in the Commission"s view the new situation in Slovakia following the elections opens up the possibility of beginning negotiations provided that the operation of the institutions proves to be orderly, stable and democratic. These Council conclusions were approved by the European Council in Vienna and made available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the political priorities listed in the accession partnership, the Council would point out the importance of the intensified accession strategy, and it encourages Slovakia to step up its preparations for membership and in doing so to accept all available assistance from the Union and to apply the provisions of the Europe Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia"s progress on the path towards accession in the light of the Copenhagen criteria will be set out in the second regular report which the Commission is to present to the European Council in Helsinki. The European Council will then take whatever decision it considers most appropriate on extending the accession negotiations to include Slovakia. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 28 by <span class="bold">Vincenzo Viola </span>(H−0190/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Interpretation of Article 158 of the Treaty of Amsterdam</p>
<p class="contents">In recent official documents, the Commission has been using a restricted interpretation of Article 158 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and one which, according to Parliament's Legal Service, is erroneous. The Commission is in the habit of referring to ‘less‐favoured islands' instead of ‘island regions', in breach of the spirit of the IGC, the Amsterdam summit and the Declaration on island regions (No 30) annexed to the Treaty. The latter has added to the less‐favoured regions of the European Union all island regions which, because of their permanent geographical handicaps, are unable to compete in the single market on equal terms with mainland regions, as a result of excessive costs regarding transport, energy, agricultural production, and the management and treatment of waste. What is the Council's interpretation of Article 158 and what specific measures will it take in order to better integrate island regions into the market on fair conditions in accordance with the IGC declaration?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would point out that it does not comment on positions taken by the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Treaty"s institutional system, it is incumbent upon the Court of Justice to ensure that the law is observed in the interpretation and application of the Treaties, including the changes made to the Treaty establishing the European Community once the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 29 by <span class="bold">James Fitzsimons </span>(H−0192/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: U‐turn by German Government on an early ban on nuclear waste</p>
<p class="contents">Will the President‐in‐Office of the Council confirm that the German Minister for the Environment has withdrawn plans for an early ban on reprocessing nuclear waste and, this being the case, will the President‐in‐Office inform the House if nuclear waste will therefore continue to be transported to the Sellafield nuclear complex for reprocessing, a move which is utterly opposed by the people of Ireland?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to which the honourable Member refers in his question is solely a matter for the Member State concerned, which is not required to notify the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear activities in the European Union are subject to the Community legislation in force. In that connection, the Council would like to point out once again that it strengthened the public health protection standards by adopting a new directive in that area in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the provisions of the Euratom Treaty, and more particularly those of Chapter III on health and safety, apply to the operation of nuclear installations in the European Union, including those for the reprocessing of irradiated fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the transport of radioactive waste is subject to specific Community legislation, Directive 92/3/Euratom on shipments of radioactive waste between Member States, and the rules drawn up by the International Atomic Energy Agency. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 30 by <span class="bold">Brian Crowley </span>(H−0198/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Fighting crime and drugs at EU level</p>
<p class="contents">Police cooperation which is essential in tackling crime at EU level has been strengthened in recent years particularly with regard to the ratification of the Europol Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the President‐in‐Office outline how it considers judicial cooperation at EU level can be developed as a further step against crime and drugs?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, the fight against crime and drugs has already been the subject of lengthy discussions at EU level and the Council has adopted a series of significant legal texts in this area. The Presidency, which endorses the statement made by the High‐Level Group on Organised Crime to the effect that judicial cooperation must be developed to a level comparable with that of police cooperation, is nevertheless determined to continue the work already started with a view to ensuring that this political objective is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, the Presidency attaches the highest priority to achieving a consensus among the EU Member States on the draft agreement on legal aid in criminal cases. The discussions on this draft, on which the European Parliament has been consulted, have been hampered by problems in connection with the issue of telecommunications monitoring; nevertheless, the Presidency will try to do everything in its power to reach a fair result by the end of its term of office. Once the agreement has been adopted, it will become a legal act which will no doubt contribute to more effective judicial cooperation, whilst safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in accordance with the Joint Action adopted by the Council on 15 December 1997, the Presidency will continue to check how judicial cooperation among the Member States is working. The conclusions of a report dealing with one particular country have already been adopted, and the competent Council working party has scheduled discussions on four further reports during this Presidency. Thereafter, the Presidency will forward to the European Parliament further details concerning the application of the assessment mechanism provided for in the Joint Action. However, it is already clear that the implementation of the Joint Action has proved beneficial with a view to the further improvement of judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Amsterdam Treaty has not yet entered into force, it can be assumed that its provisions will further extend the scope for improvements in judicial cooperation. As provided for in the action plan, the fight against crime and drugs will have a vital part to play in the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. For that reason, the Presidency is currently giving priority to the smooth entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, so that, immediately thereafter, the Council is in a position to work effectively. In that connection, not least as regards judicial cooperation in the fight against crime and drug trafficking, the integration of Schengen is of central importance. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 31 by <span class="bold">Pat Gallagher </span>(H−0200/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Venture capital for small firms in peripheral areas</p>
<p class="contents">As the Council is aware, 28 venture capital funds have united to invest more than ? 490 million in young, technologically innovative companies. Venture capital operators must devote at least 25 % of newly collected capital in investment for the starting up of technologically innovative SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">What assurances can the Council give that innovative companies in the technological field in peripheral areas such as the west of Ireland will receive priority consideration?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 May 1998 the Council adopted a financial assistance programme in favour of innovative and job‐creating small and medium‐sized firms. This programme consists of three complementary facilities, namely a risk capital facility, a joint European venture facility and a loan guarantee facility. The first and the third facilities are implemented by the European Investment Fund and the second by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">All Community small and medium‐sized firms which meet the criteria of the programme are in principle eligible to benefit from the facilities provided therein which have no special priority focus for companies established in peripheral regions of the Community. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 32 by <span class="bold">Liam Hyland </span>(H−0201/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Colour‐code symbol for GMOs in food products</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council actively support the introduction of an internationally recognised colour‐code symbol for food products containing GMOs along the lines of, for example, the internationally recognised leather and wool symbols which would make the immediate identification of GMOs possible and which would therefore be consumer friendly?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not submitted to the Council any proposals dealing with the problem raised by the honourable Member. It goes without saying that the Council will pay the closest possible attention to any such proposals, should they be submitted. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 33 by <span class="bold">Hans Lindqvist </span>(H−0202/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU aid to Morocco</p>
<p class="contents">Morocco has occupied Western Sahara for almost 24 years in violation of the UN Charter and international law. It is not reasonable for Morocco to receive large sums in aid from the EU without any demands being made that the occupied Sahrawis be allowed to exercise their right of self‐determination in accordance with the UN peace plan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is common knowledge that Morocco has in various ways impeded, stalled and obstructed the peace process and continues to sabotage the UN's work. Morocco also violates human rights, both in that country itself and in occupied Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council consider it reasonable for Morocco to receive substantial EU aid at the same time as that country spends enormous amounts on the occupation of Western Sahara, which is a violation of the UN Charter and international law?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has supported the UN peace efforts in Western Sahara right from their beginning, with the clear hope that this would contribute to allowing the people of Western Sahara to exercise their right to self‐determination.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council has been following developments in Morocco and Western Sahara, both on the ground and in the UN in New York. It has been regularly debating the UN Secretary‐General's initiatives within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with its continuing support for the efforts of the UNSG, the Presidency on 29 December 1998 issued a declaration on behalf of the EU: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ supporting the settlement plan for Western Sahara proposed by the UNSG, for Western Sahara, which aims at the holding of a free, fair and impartial referendum on the self‐determination of the people of Western Sahara; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ taking note of the completion of the identification of more than 147 000 applicants to the referendum while regretting the divergences on the issue of three contested tribal groupings; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ welcoming the arbitration presented by the UNSG in order to move the identification process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It also encouraged parties to formalise the presence of the UNHCR in the territory and to conclude the refugee repatriation protocol; it finally called for a prompt signing of the still outstanding status of forces agreement on MINURSO.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, the EU noted with satisfaction that the Moroccan Government has accepted the conditions outlined by the UNSG for the holding of the referendum and is hopeful that this attitude will ensure progress towards the objective of self‐determination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council does not believe that steps such as a cessation of economic assistance to Morocco would contribute to a settlement on Western Sahara. It also has to be kept in mind that Morocco is an important stable and moderate partner of the EU, both bilaterally and in the framework of the Barcelona Process. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 34 by <span class="bold">Jan Bertens </span>(H−0204/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Policy of the European Union on child soldiers</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the President of the Council, during the ceremony of remembrance for the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December 1998, mentioned the problem of child soldiers. However, the meeting of the working party of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which seeks to reach agreement on an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, failed yet again to arrive at such agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the President of the Council endorse the substance of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament in December?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council agree with the European Parliament that the minimum age for recruitment into the army should be 18?</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Council consider that the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child can be concluded this year?</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Council intend to help prevent the participation of children in wars in conflict zones outside Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has taken note of the resolution by the European Parliament on child soldiers and agrees with the Parliament that the EU should do its utmost to abolish the use of children in armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Promotion of the Rights of the Child in general is a high priority for the Council. The Presidency, in its address to the 53rd session of the UN General Assembly, underlined the importance of this issue and called for a global coalition to promote children's rights and to fight against the exploitation of children. Reference was made to that problem in the Vienna declaration on the 50th anniversary of the UDHR (10 December 1998). The EU's position is based on the fundamental principle that children must live a childhood in peace, freedom, prosperity and security, free of abuse, violence and exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The action of the UN Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict, Mr Otunnu, and of his predecessor Ms Machel, has been actively supported by the EU. The Presidency and Member States are in particular committed to fostering progress on the text of the draft optional protocol on involvement of children in armed conflict, for which Sweden is playing a leading role. The EU considers that the minimum age for recruitment of soldiers should be 18 years. Once a text is agreed upon, the EU will encourage all states to adhere to the optional protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU also welcomes the fact that, under Article 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the conscription or enlistment of children under the age of 15 into armed forces or their active participation in hostilities, whether international or internal, are considered as war crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the Court. This will contribute to preventing the direct involvement of children in hostilities and thus decrease the risks of their exposure to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU regularly raises the issue of the Rights of the Child in its political dialogue meetings with third countries. Where relevant, it calls upon parties directly or indirectly involved in conflicts to respect existing international standards and to make every effort possible to protect children from violence. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 35 by <span class="bold">Vassilis Ephremidis </span>(H−0207/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Farmers' demonstration in Brussels and position adopted by the EU institutions</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 February some 50 000 farmers from all over Europe converged on Brussels to protest against the proposals set out in Agenda 2000 and the reform of the CAP. This mass demonstration by European farmers was met by 5 000 Belgian police officers in a city which was practically in a state of siege where almost every activity had been legally brought to a halt, while the EU institutions – including the European Parliament, the only EU institution directly elected by the peoples of Europe – were closed for the day as an emergency measure, to protect them from ‘invasions' by the demonstrating farmers whose demands they refused to listen to; all staff were given extraordinary leave.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the much vaunted principles of a Citizens' Europe, will the Council – which at this moment is meeting to discuss agricultural affairs – say whether the position it and all the other EU institutions adopted is in keeping with the above principles and, if so, whether by its contempt for collective expressions of opinion, its strong‐arm police tactics and the criminalisation of demonstrations the EU is seeking to intimidate and suppress all those who wish to resist, air their grievances and protest, such as European farmers on this occasion?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the honourable Member"s question I can only stress – although I hardly think it necessary – that the maintenance of law and order within the territory of a given Member State falls exclusively within the competence of the police forces of that Member State. As a result, the Council regrets to inform the honourable Member that it is not in a position to reply to the various questions raised about police deployment during the farmers" demonstration in Brussels on 22 February. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 36 by <span class="bold">Antonios Trakatellis </span>(H−0208/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Nuclear safety and enlargement</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account the conclusions of the Council<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which were endorsed by the European Council meeting in Vienna and which emphasised that nuclear safety was a priority in the partnership agreements between the EU and the candidate countries and that nuclear reactors in these countries which for reasons of cost cannot be upgraded to meet internationally acceptable standards must be closed down as soon as possible on the basis of the partnership obligations agreed on and the agreements regarding the Nuclear Safety Account (NSA): </p>
<p class="contents">What initiatives and measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that the priorities contained in the partnership agreements regarding nuclear safety are respected by the candidate countries?</p>
<p class="contents">What immediate measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that the first‐generation nuclear reactors (VVER 440/230 and RBMK) in Bulgaria and Lithuania are closed down in accordance with the commitments assumed by these two countries as part of the partnership agreements and the agreements with the NSA?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">On numerous occasions, the Council has already stressed the importance it attaches to a high level of nuclear safety and environmental protection at an international scale. This issue is of particular relevance for the candidate States of Central and Eastern Europe, in particular in view of their legacy of Soviet‐design nuclear power reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has been taking every opportunity, in particular in the framework of the Europe Agreement and throughout the Accession Process, for reiterating the need for the earliest practicable closure of those nuclear power reactors which cannot be upgraded to internationally accepted levels of safety at a reasonable cost. Any plans going in that direction should be consistent with the priorities contained in the Accession Partnerships and the requirements of the Nuclear Safety Account Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member has already highlighted, the essential elements of the Community stance in this regard are reflected in Council conclusions on nuclear safety and enlargement, as adopted on 7 December 1998 and later endorsed by the European Council in Vienna.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Bulgaria, the Council notes the preparation of an action plan and the recent adoption of a long‐term strategy aiming at the integration of the national energy system and energy market into the European Union. The Council underlines the importance of the respect of international commitments regarding early closure of units 1‐4 of NPP in Kozloduy.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Lithuania, the Council regrets that the draft energy strategy presented by the Lithuanian Government to Parliament last December is not in line with the Accession Partnership since it is not compatible with the commitments under the Nuclear Safety Account Agreement. On the occasion of the recent meeting of the Association Council, the Council again encouraged Lithuania to establish as soon as possible a comprehensive, long‐term, energy strategy. This strategy should be based on efficiency, diversification and respect of nuclear safety standards. It should include realistic power plant closure commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">For both countries, pre‐accession aid under the PHARE Programme will certainly continue to play an important role in this regard. The Council is looking forward to a communication from the Commission relating to the improvement of the assistance operations in the field of nuclear safety, taking into account the remarks of the Court of Auditors in its recent Special Report, as well as the enlargement process. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 37 by <span class="bold">Christine Oddy </span>(H−0210/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Persecution of Christians in India</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council of Ministers indicate to the Indian Government its disapproval of persecution of Christians in India?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The violent clashes between different religious groups in India towards the end of last, and beginning of this year, have been noticed with concern by the Council. This concern, including the concern felt for the Christian minority, has been raised by the Presidency in its regular contacts with the Indian authorities. In these contacts the Presidency has drawn attention to the possible damage of these clashes to the image of India as a secular society and, furthermore, expressed appreciation of efforts already undertaken by India to restore confidence in the secular traditions of the country. Mutually shared – between the Union and India – principles of protection of minorities and freedom of religion have also been stressed in these contacts. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 38 by <span class="bold">John McCartin </span>(H−0212/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: 24 Mile Exclusive Fishing Zone</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the decision of the European Parliament to extend the 12 mile exclusive fishing zone to 24 miles and is there any proposal before the Council to take a decision on this matter or has it ever been discussed at Council level?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware of the Resolution of the European Parliament of 25 February 1999 on the regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy (A4‐0018/99), in which Parliament calls on the Commission to propose the extension of the 12‐mile limit to 24 miles in the context of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Council pointed out in its reply to Oral Question No H−0686/98 put by Mr Teverson and Oral Question No H−0569/98 put by Ms McIntosh, the Commission's preparatory work on the review of Regulation No 3760/92 is still under way, an oral report on the state of play having been given by the Commission to the Council at its meeting of 8 June 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council notes Parliament's view on the extension of the 12‐mile zone to 24 miles, but cannot prejudge at this stage neither any proposals which the Commission might consider appropriate to submit to the Council in the context of the review of this Regulation, nor the final outcome of the Council deliberation on this proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 39 by <span class="bold">Richard Howitt </span>(H−0216/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Joint Declaration</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council act upon the recommendation of the Joint Anglo/German/French Declaration of the Development Ministers signed in February 1999 to improve concentration of responsibilities for development issues in the future Commission so that there will be one single Development Commissioner in the new European Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council as an institution cannot comment on measures taken outside its formal meetings. Moreover, the allocation of tasks within the Commission is a matter for the Commission itself, since, pursuant to Article 162 of the Treaty, 'the Commission shall adopt its rules of procedure so as to ensure that both it and its departments operate in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty. It shall ensure that these rules are published.' </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 40 by <span class="bold">Hugh Kerr </span>(H−0218/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Follow‐up of the Commission working document and the Council resolution on policy on indigenous peoples in development cooperation</p>
<p class="contents">In the past year the Commission held a seminar meeting on policy on indigenous peoples in developing countries in Spring 1998. It then adopted the working document (SEC(1998)773 fin.) in May and finally, the Council on Development adopted a resolution on 30 November 1998. The ministers instructed an expert group on social development to discuss the implementation of the proposed actions and to make further proposals. Who nominates the members of the expert group, who sets its agenda, what is the formal status of this expert group and what has this group done since November? Is the indigenous policy on the agenda for its next meetings? Have they or are they intending to invite indigenous representatives and NGOs to participate in these debates?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council stresses the importance and the urgent need to implement the strategic approach set out in the Council Resolution of 30 November 1998 on support for indigenous peoples in development cooperation. In this context, the honourable Member's attention is drawn to the fact that the responsibility for the setting‐up of expert groups lies with the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">All questions concerning the expert group on social development, the nomination of its members, its agenda and the participation of indigenous peoples and NGOs should therefore be addressed to the Commission. </p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<p class="contents">Question No 49 by <span class="bold">Karl Habsburg‐Lothringen </span>(H−0195/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Fraud involving subsidies</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control has uncovered massive fraud relating to the EU budget. Subsidies are very often the subject of fraud. When does the Commission intend to make practical proposals to cut back subsidies and ease the tax burden on EU citizens so that they are no longer exploited as they are at present?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would first like to point out that the scale of fraud and irregularities relating to expenditure has to be interpreted with great caution. As indicated in the last annual report on the fight against fraud, fraud and irregularities detected by the Member States and the Commission on the expenditure side of the European budget had a budgetary impact of EUR 406 million in 1997, equivalent to 0.5 % of total expenditure. The Commission's Task Force for Coordination of the fight against fraud regularly provides information to the Budgetary Control Committee of the European Parliament on concrete cases under investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view of the honourable Member that the Community budget has to be implemented with all the necessary control measures so that fraud and irregularities do not occur or are duly penalised, and assurance can be given to the European taxpayer that public funds are not misused. It is of the utmost importance that European policies are not undermined by fraud as the purpose of the European budget is to make progress in the construction of Europe. The Commission would nevertheless stress the fact that the Member States are primarily responsible for the management of +/‐ 80 of the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore defined its strategy to fight against fraud and irregularities. The Commission would in this context mention the 1998/1999 annual work programme on the fight against fraud which contains coherent concrete actions concerning both operational activities and the legal framework. Moreover, the Commission has adopted the initiative SEM 2000 in order to improve the management of expenditure in cooperation with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is determined to continue the work with the Member States to ensure that expenditure programmes as well as collection of own resources are properly implemented and controlled, and that European taxpayers therefore get value for money. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 60 by <span class="bold">Manuel Medina Ortega </span>(H−0178/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Criteria to assess non‐profit‐making investment in the future of the European electricity sector</p>
<p class="contents">What competition policy criteria does the Commission intend to adopt to assess non‐profit‐making investment effected by the electricity sector arising out of the universal service obligations established within regulatory frameworks prior to liberalisation? Does it intend to consider only the economic evaluations submitted by undertakings and Member States, or will it compare them with independent audits which take the established market value into account? Are its competition policy services sufficiently capable of ascertaining whether a part of the investment was financed from State aid at any time?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will assess the investments to which the honourable Member refers in the light of the provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 96/92/EC of 19 December 1996 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity as well as the provisions of the EC Treaty relating to state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently considering the information provided by the various Member States that have informed us of their systems of ‘stranded costs". It would be premature at this stage to say whether or not we will have to ask independent experts to analyse this information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that, in principle, its own administrative services are quite capable of carrying out a correct appraisal of this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 61 by <span class="bold">Helena Torres Marques </span>(H−0181/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Lack of competition amongst electronic money payment systems</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the problems relating to a lack of competition which are arising in connection with payments made by means of electronic cards, would the Commission answer the following questions? On 22 May 1997, Eurocommerce lodged a complaint with the DG responsible for competition regarding anti‐competitive practices relating to payments made by means of electronic cards in certain EU countries. Why has no reply yet been sent in response to that complaint?</p>
<p class="contents">Why are businesses (especially ones within the euro area) required to establish contracts in order to be able to use electronic payment systems within their own country, instead of being able to use the services provided by companies which issue electronic money (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners Club, etc.) under the most favourable conditions available on the various markets? Traders, service providers and consumers all have to pay much higher rates which are specific to each country. How can such a state of affairs be regarded as compatible with the internal market and the single currency?</p>
<p class="contents">How is it possible that, for example, in Portugal, traders should be required to pay the same rate to all the electronic money issuing companies, there being no competition amongst the cards issued by the various companies?</p>
<p class="contents">How is it possible that traders in Portugal should be required to pay exactly the same rate for using both credit cards and debit cards (if they have both systems), even though the bank charges obviously differ?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Member of the European Parliament asks first of all, why the complaint from Eurocommerce concerning various alleged anti‐competitive practices in the payment card sector has not yet received a reply. In fact, this complaint is against a large number of different card payment systems, both at international level, and domestic systems in several Member States. The case therefore involves a very large amount of research into the facts concerning many card payment systems, which takes some time. In addition, the complaint has to be dealt with in conjunction with a number of notifications received by the Commission from certain card payment systems, which partly cover the same issues as the complaint. Eurocommerce has however been in regular contact with the Commission, and is informed of the state of the investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question seems to refer to the fact that most international card payment and electronic money systems are divided into national licensing areas, within each of which the members of the system can determine the conditions of use of the system for domestic payments, within the boundaries imposed by the rules of the international payment scheme operator in question. The conditions and charges for domestic payments therefore vary between Member States, and are higher in some Member States than others. Following the notifications already referred to, the Commission is currently looking into some of these arrangements, in order to determine whether any aspect of them is incompatible with the Treaty rules on competition. As a general rule, territorial licensing is not in itself anti‐competitive, but it may in some cases involve certain restrictions which are infringements of the competition rules (concerning absolute territorial protection, for example).</p>
<p class="contents">As to the third question, whether this situation of territorial licensing is compatible with the single market and with the single currency, the Commission would point out that payment cards fall fully within the scope of the Second Banking Directive, which establishes a full single market for banking activities. Territorial licensing in itself is not incompatible with the directive, but the right of establishment and cross‐border provision of services, with home country supervision, as laid down in the directive, must be respected. The same applies for the euro: the euro does not require the abolition of all territorial licenses in the banking sector, but the full respect of the single market legislation should ensure healthy competition between banks, including in the field of payment cards.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question concerns the issuing of electronic money in Portugal. The Commission is not familiar with the details of the issuing of electronic money in Portugal, and therefore cannot answer this question. The Commission would point out that it has not so far received any formal complaint or informal correspondence concerning electronic money in Portugal, nor has the Portuguese competition authority – the complaint from Eurocommerce to the Commission concerns ‘traditional' payment cards, not electronic money cards, and the same is true of a current case before the Portuguese Competition Council. If the Member of the European Parliament has any specific information which she wished the Commission to consider, the Commission will be happy to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth question asks why merchants in Portugal pay the same fees for the acceptance of credit cards as for debit cards. The Commission would point out first of all that undertakings, including card acquiring bodies, are free to choose at what price they offer a service, as long as the pricing is not an abuse of a dominant position or agreed with other undertakings. On the particular subject of credit and debit cards, it is not clear to the Commission that the costs of processing transactions carried out by debit and credit cards are necessarily different. Whether a card carried a credit or debit function, and the pricing of the credit, is a matter between a card issuing bank and the cardholder, which should not inevitably lead to different costs or prices for a merchant who accepts these cards. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 62 by <span class="bold">Gary Titley </span>(H−0197/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: European Aerospace and Defence Industry</p>
<p class="contents">One member of the Commission has recently advocated strongly the restructuring of the European defence industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Another member of the Commission, however, has raised questions about recent proposed mergers in the defence sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission clarify whether or not it believes the creation of a single European Aerospace &amp; Defence Company would be a beneficial development or whether it would be counter to EU competition policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the honourable Member focuses primarily on competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, since other Members of the Commission are currently engaged in various initiatives all aiming at reshaping defence industry and markets in Europe, which will thus determine the background against which to assess any future competition case, it is clear that the position of the Commission on these issues can only be built by constant review by the College of how all these initiatives are progressing.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this is a very complex issue that may be looked at from various viewpoints and that presents implications which often go beyond the individual Community policies for which the Commission is responsible under Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has explicitly recognised the need for the European defence industry to consolidate in order to remain competitive in the face of the reduction in defence budgets, the rise in the costs of armament programmes and increasing competition from large US companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The increasing number of mergers and cooperative agreements between companies is in line with the requirements of dynamic competition and capable of increasing the competitiveness of the European industry. However the Commission would like to stress that preserving an adequate degree of competition is equally an important source of industry's competitiveness. That is why concentration is welcomed provided it does not result in lasting damage to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the competitive impact of larger mergers and possibly of the creation of a Single European Aerospace and Defence Company needs to be assessed on each individual product and geographic market in order to avoid any unnecessary market foreclosure.</p>
<p class="contents">The geographic scope of competition is crucial and must be determined, for each individual sector, having regard to the ongoing opening‐up of national markets and of procurement practices. Actual or potential competition from US producers shall be taken into account whenever appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">At first sight, and without prejudice to a more complete analysis, for which the Commission lacks at present the necessary elements, the Commission cannot exclude that for certain military products (such as e.g. large aircraft programmes covering a long‐time horizon), one sole European company could both be industrially and economically the most rational solution and at the same time not lead to any harm to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this may well not be the case for other products. Considerations such as the relationships between producers and Ministries of Defence within the specific programmes, the maintaining of national and specific requirements or procurement practices of certain Member States, the existence of spill‐over effects onto civilian markets (especially in the context of so‐called dual use technologies), and the potential for vertical or conglomerate foreclosure must be taken into account as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission would like to emphasise that any decision of the Commission on competition issues cannot prevent Member States, under Article 223 EC, from taking measures that are necessary for the protection of national security interests. Such measures may, however, not adversely affect the conditions of competition in the common market regarding products which are not intended for specifically military purposes. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Sabena flights to Strasbourg during part‐session weeks</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian national airline Sabena discriminates against economy class travellers on the route between Brussels and Strasbourg during the European Parliament's part‐session weeks. The airline prohibits the purchase of other than business class tickets for certain departures. This causes problems to other passengers, not least with regard to the compatibility of timetables and the limited alternative travel possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that in acting in this way Sabena is abusing its dominant position on the Brussels‐Strasbourg route? What measures does the Commission propose to take to put pressure on Sabena to halt the discrimination against economy class travellers on this route?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Following the question posed by the honourable Member during the December 1998 part‐session, the Commission asked Sabena to provide it with very detailed information, in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation No 3975/87. Sabena sent us a letter dated 18 February 1999 asking for an extension of the deadline so that they could provide us with information that was as comprehensive as possible, which they had to obtain from several of their departments. We are expecting their reply this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the Commission is in a position to propose the line to follow subsequently, I will write to you immediately with the details. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 64 by <span class="bold">Per Gahrton </span>(H−0109/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Sweden's environmental derogations</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Sweden's environmental derogations expired at the end of last year. From its entry into the EU up to and including 31 December 1998, Sweden was to be allowed to retain its own, sometimes more stringent, environmental regulations, during which time the EU was to tighten up its regulations. Can the Commission explain what has happened to these derogations and to what extent the EU's regulations have come closer to the Swedish ones and vice versa, if Sweden, now that its derogations have expired, is being forced to fall into line with existing EU standards? What action will the EU propose if Swedish environmental regulations continue to be incompatible with the EU's regulations?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">When Sweden, Austria and Finland joined the Community a special provision – the Review Clause – in the Act of Accession allowed these three new Member States to keep certain different national health and environmental provisions for four years until 31 December 1998. The Community reviewed during this time its own health and environmental standards accordingly, in close cooperation with the three new Member States. In almost all cases, solutions were found within the time‐period in order to enable Sweden to keep its high environmental and health standards after the expiry of the derogations in the Act of Accession. In many cases, Community legislation has already been adopted which strengthen the standards all over the Community. In some cases, the Commission has tabled the necessary proposals under the different directives within the scheduled time and they now remain with the European Parliament and the Council for decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">In a limited number of cases, time gaps between the end of the transitional period and the final adoption of new acts might occur. Nevertheless, no practical problems are expected since all parties concerned are aware of on‐going developments. The legal changes will either correspond to the Swedish standards for the protection of human health and the environment or enable them to have a prolonged time‐period for the derogations in question. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 65 by <span class="bold">Pat Gallagher </span>(H−0110/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Vienna Summit and proposals concerning duty‐free sales</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the conclusions of the Vienna Summit, will the Commission confirm that it will be bringing forward specific proposals, and not merely a discussion or working document, in order to alleviate any negative socio‐economic consequences arising from the abolition of duty‐free sales and that these proposals will include the possibility of a limited extension of the current transitional arrangements?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 February 1999, in response to the request made at the European Council meeting held on 11 and 12 December 1998 in Vienna, the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council concerning the employment aspects of the decision to abolish tax‐ and duty‐free sales for intra‐Community travellers. That document was forwarded to the Council and European Parliament and bears the reference number COM(99)65.</p>
<p class="contents">The document was drawn up in a genuine spirit of openness and duly analysed the possibility of an extension of the transitional period applicable to intra‐Community tax‐ and duty‐free sales in accordance with various procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of that analysis, the Commission takes the view that the employment problems are not macro‐economic in nature but are limited and sectoral, involving in particular the maritime sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, it takes the view that an extension of the current provisions does not constitute an appropriate response to the employment problems in this context. The Commission also drew up a list of the existing Community instruments capable of cushioning any adverse effects. Funds are available as from 1 January 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, since November 1998 it has been calling on the Member States to ensure that they make full use of all the opportunities available to them in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is prepared to review, if the Council should so wish, the possibility of creating a new instrument in addition to the Community instruments already available. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 66 by <span class="bold">John Cushnahan </span>(H−0180/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Duty free</p>
<p class="contents">The recent Commission Communication on the abolition of Duty Free claims that job losses resulting from duty free abolition will not be significant and suggests that any ‘potential' job losses arising from duty free abolition will be sectoral and short term. In the annex to the document the Commission gives an aggregate total of 56 000 job losses while glossing over the fact that this total comprises submissions from only 10 Member States on direct job losses and a mere 7 on indirect job losses. At a time when employment considerations are at the core of EU policy, how can the Commission display such indifference towards EU citizens and their livelihoods?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Such a figure of 56 000 job losses is not contained anywhere in the communication the Commission adopted on 17 February 1999. Consequently, this figure cannot be attributed to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to reply to the European Council in Vienna, the Commission asked all Member States to provide information on the employment effects of the abolition of intra‐Community duty‐free sales.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States replied, providing different figures calculated by using different methods. In certain cases, indirect effects have been integrated; in other cases, only direct effects. Elsewhere, the whole of the duty‐free sales activity, and not only the intra‐Community part, has been taken into account. In another, the overall effect, including the effect of the recycling of the extra tax revenues, has been computed, yielding a result of net increase in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It means that the information obtained from the 15 Member States cannot be added: it would be like adding apples and pears. Nevertheless, it does give a general picture, an order of magnitude of the real impact of the abolition of the duty‐free exemption, and it allows us to estimate the adequacy of the instruments proposed. It confirms that, within the Community, there is no macro‐economic effect, but limited, specific and local effects.</p>
<p class="contents">To properly address these effects, the Commission believes that an extension of the transitional arrangements is too broad an instrument and considers it more appropriate to apply more targeted, specific instruments such as the existing Commission instruments described in the communication, while being open to examine the creation of an ad hoc instrument. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 67 by <span class="bold">Richard Corbett </span>(H−0112/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Protectionist proposals concerning wine bottling</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of all the consequences that would arise from its proposal to allow Member States to make the bottling of wine in the specified region of production compulsory for certain quality wines (Proposal to amend Regulation EEC/823/87<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> ). What advice does the Commission give to companies which import wine in bulk and which have invested in plant and equipment for such purposes, when such investment will be rendered worthless if the Commission's proposal is adopted?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Commission would like to make it clear that its proposal seeking to permit Member States, under very restrictive conditions, to make the bottling of wine compulsory in the specified regions of production for certain quality wines is not designed to impose a general application of the restriction of movement on quality wines psr in bulk.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, the Commission proposed that possibility to the Council because it took the view that this measure, which is justified by arguments relating to the law and to quality, must be strictly framed at Community level so that it is limited solely to quality wines psr which justify it on a technical level and where most of the producers of the wine of designated origin concerned (90 %) so decide.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also provides for a five‐year transitional period after its entry into force so that companies which bottle the wine outside the specified region will have a period of at least three years in which to adapt to the new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">At all events, this measure does not affect, apart from most quality wines psr, table wines, including local wines, which account, on average, for 65 % of Community wine production. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Regulations concerning the approval for the production of retreaded tyres</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the environmental impact of the retreaded tyre industry in recycling used tyres, as emphasised by DG XI's Used Tyre Working Group's recommendations in 1994, and of the economic importance of the retreading industry, which is composed of small and medium‐sized companies and accounts for 50 % of the commercial vehicle replacement tyre market, should the Commission not give high priority to the adoption of UN ECE Regulations 108/109, which recommend provisions concerning approval for the production of retreaded tyres, and immediate consideration to a harmonised Council directive providing a level playing field for the retreaded tyre industry as was done for the new tyre industry through Directives 92/23/EEC<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and 92/53/EEC<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> .</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the honourable Member's question, the Commission wishes to inform him that the possibility is being considered of the Community's acceding to the UNECE's Regulations 108<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and 109<a href="#def_1_6" name="ref_1_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> as part of the European Community's accession to the Revised Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Experts in most Member States, as well as several representatives of the industry concerned, have shown their interest in the EC's acceding to the two regulations concerning retreaded tyres.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it has not yet been possible to reach agreement on a definitive decision concerning the EC's formal accession to Regulations 108 and 109 since the representatives of the small and medium‐sized businesses in the retreaded tyres sector have indicated that the regulations would be particularly damaging to their businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will persist in its efforts to seek a solution which will satisfy all the sectors concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted, however, that the final decision concerning the EC's accession to Regulations 108 and 109 is a matter for the Council, and that the Council will not be able to take such a decision until Parliament has given its assent. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 69 by <span class="bold">Liam Hyland </span>(H−0118/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Concerns of the European Council of Young Farmers about cost differentials</p>
<p class="contents">A study published recently by the European Council of Young Farmers (CEJA) has highlighted a loophole in the single market. While constrained to sell at set prices, European farmers face huge differences in their everyday costs from one EU Member State to another.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that Article 36 of the EC Treaty is being used to justify the prohibition of the import and export of agricultural machinery and plant protection chemicals, even though they are commonly used throughout the European Union, thereby causing significant differences in farm costs in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission, which is responsible for policing Member States' implementation of these exemptions and for ensuring the proper functioning of the single market, aware of this problem, and how does it intend to act to improve the situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to plant protection products, Directive 91/414/EEC provides for a framework which harmonises the conditions under which these products are authorised for marketing and use in the Member States. Given the risks that these products may have for human health and the environment, as well as the divergent agricultural, plant health and environmental conditions prevailing throughout the Community, Member States are authorised under this Directive to require a specific national authorisation for the marketing and use of plant protection products. The existence of national authorisation procedures and considerable price differentials have promoted parallel trade in plant protection products between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that harmonisation is also a gradual process over time as regards the active substances in pesticides, the Directive becoming obligatory only after their human health and environmental characteristics have been reassessed in accordance with the 12‐year re‐evaluation programme provided for by the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not been notified of any technical difficulties concerning agricultural machinery, which is covered by Directive 98/37/EC on machinery. That Directive covers all new machinery and second‐hand machinery originating in third countries. Second‐hand machinery from Community countries is covered by rules laid down by the Member States on the basis of the amended Directive 89/655/EEC. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Fishing dispute in Gibraltar</p>
<p class="contents">What action has the Commission taken and what action will it take to stop British naval vessels from harassing Spanish fishermen in the waters around Gibraltar, and to ensure application of the agreement reached last Autumn in Luxembourg between the British and Spanish Ministers for Foreign Affairs?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission ask the UK to withdraw the charges brought against 14 fishermen detained and subsequently released on bail?</p>
<p class="contents">What action has the Commission taken and what action will it take to ensure the application of more than 60 Community directives which are currently being ignored in Gibraltar, such as those concerning the environment, freedom of movement, banking, property, company law, etc., which are especially harmful to Spain?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The conflict to which the honourable Member refers is not the result of a violation by the parties involved of the Community"s regulations or provisions on the common fisheries policy. As a result, the Commission can but hope that the disagreements will be resolved bilaterally as soon as possible through the traditional channels of dialogue and consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission seeks to ensure the correct implementation of Community Directives in Gibraltar as it does in all areas of the Community, taking account of the particular regime that applies to Gibraltar as defined, in particular, in the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom. Where appropriate, it has launched infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom for failure to implement applicable Directives. In the area of company law, for example, the Commission has sent four reasoned opinions to the United Kingdom for failure to implement company law Directives in the territory of Gibraltar. The Directives in question, which concern the annual accounts of companies and the consolidated accounts of groups, are the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives (78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC) and subsequent amendments (90/604/EEC and 90/605/EEC). </p>

<p class="contents">Question No 72 by <span class="bold">Veronica Hardstaff </span>(H−0122/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Maltreatment of ponies in France</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that Pottok ponies, whose breeders in the French Pyrenees receive EU grants equivalent to £100 per animal, are alleged to be subjected to extreme cruelty involving being shackled to wooden stocks?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission investigate the way in which this money is being used, and make clear that it will only be paid if the ponies are treated according to high levels of animal welfare?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can confirm that this breed, which has been notified to the Commission as an endangered breed, is included within the agri‐environment programme in the Aquitaine region of France under a measure for the preservation of rare breeds of farm animals. The payment level (premia) is 300 FF (about 45 euro) per animal. This measure is intended to contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">As a condition of approval of the programme, the Commission provided that the commitments entered into by farmers must be in compliance with all applicable Community regulations with regard to animal welfare. However, no specific Community rules applied to the keeping of horses until 1998, when Directive 98/58/EC of 20 July 1998 concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes was approved by the Council. This provides that Member States shall ensure that owners or keepers of animals take all reasonable steps to ensure the welfare of animals under their care and to ensure that those animals are not caused any unnecessary pain, suffering or injury (Article 3). The Annex to the Directive gives further detail on standards to apply in respect of tethered animals.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, the Commission is making enquiries with the French authorities concerning the situation relating to the Pottock horse and the application of Directive 98/58/EC. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 73 by <span class="bold">Richard Balfe </span>(H−0123/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Contract payment delays</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of recent events, the Commission will want the public to view its financial management as efficient and fair. The important work of the Tacis Finance Unit reflects both on the Commission and on the EU as a whole, yet some external contractors, including my constituents, have experienced delays of up to two years (rather than the Commission's 60‐day target) for payment.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to investigate how payments can be made more rapidly and more efficiently, in particular payments made by the TFU to outside contractors and consultants?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets the delays which have occurred with TACIS payments. In 1998, this arose from the combination of a number of factors including the unavailability of payment credits, a reorganisation within the Commission, but also because claims submitted were often not supported by the documentation required under the contract. The average time taken to make payments for the first ten months of 1998 was 73.6 days. As to 1999, it was not possible to make any payments between 18 December 1998 and late February 1999 because of the transfer from one automatic system to the other (SINCOM 1 to SINCOM 2).</p>
<p class="contents">As explained in the Commission's reply to written questions E−3500 and E−3796, since becoming operational in the latter part of 1998, the Commission has made significant efforts towards tackling the delays and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">More fundamentally, the Commission has launched a review of the payment conditions in standard TACIS contracts. The intention is to strengthen verification and – at the same time – simplify and harmonise the procedures. Moreover, the revised payment conditions would ultimately speed up the processing of payment claims under the new contracts. Taking into account the complex legal aspects of this task, the Commission hopes to complete the definition of the new payment conditions by the end of 1999. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Incomplete answer to a question concerning early retirement pensions</p>
<p class="contents">Why, in the answer it gave at the January part‐session to a question on the compatibility of the Danish early retirement pension scheme with Community law, did the Commission totally omit to mention that it had already drawn up a proposal to amend Regulation EEC/1408/71<a href="#def_1_7" name="ref_1_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> so as to bring the Danish early retirement pension scheme within the scope of the basic social security regulation?

<p class="contents">Will the Commission take steps to ensure that questions submitted by Members of the European Parliament are taken seriously?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets that the honourable Member is not satisfied with the answer given to Oral Question H−1235/98 concerning the ‘efterløn'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can indeed confirm that, on 21 December 1998, it adopted a proposal for a general reform of Regulation 1408/71<a href="#def_1_8" name="ref_1_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> . In this proposal a new chapter has been included which aims to extend the material scope of Regulation 1408/71 to pre‐retirement schemes similar to ‘efterløn'<a href="#def_1_9" name="ref_1_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> . The Commission did not refer to this proposal in its first answer because although it is now on the table of the Council, the proposal has not yet been discussed in that forum and, therefore, it was considered that it could not realistically provide a solution to the matters raised by the honourable Member in his earlier question.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to find a quick solution to the problems cased by Danish legislation the Commission has taken the initiative of writing to the Danish Government with the aim of finding out whether the situation is in line with principles of the Treaty as recently interpreted by the ECJ<a href="#def_1_10" name="ref_1_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> . </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 75 by <span class="bold">Clive Needle </span>(H−0128/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Health and human development in the developing countries</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty eradication is, quite rightly, an increasingly important focus for the European Union's development policies. Could the Commission inform us of any reflection taking place within the Commission on how to intervene more effectively in meeting the needs of the poorest, and what this entails for our policy priorities and our programme approach in the developing countries, in particular in what are known as the human development sectors such as health and education? Will the Commission be publishing its views on the intricate links between health and other aspects of human development in the form of a Commission Communication to be submitted to Parliament and Council?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Community, as well as the Member States, are very much aware of the necessity to contribute to the eradication of poverty and thereby to meet the needs of the poorest. They have committed themselves to reaching the objectives set in the Declarations and Programmes of Action of the last UN Conferences (Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing). There is a consensus among donors to work towards the achievement of the DAC international objectives of sustainable development. This is reflected in the mandate for a new partnership with the ACP countries, in which poverty reduction and ultimately eradication is considered as the overarching goal of the development cooperation, in accordance with the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Community will focus more and more on the needs of the poorest countries; the allocation of development resources will be set according to the needs, but also the performance.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with its international commitments, the Community has increasingly focused the allocation of its financial resources on human and social development. This is particularly the case in its relations with ACP countries within the framework of the LOMÉ Conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The programming and implementation of the 8th European Development Fund shows a strong increase of Community financial commitments on basic social services, mainly basic health and education sector (<span class="italic">+</span> 1 billion euro allocation on 8th EDF). It also includes the fight against AIDS and increased importance given to transectoral priorities like gender issues in all development programmes. Increased support to basic health and education in ACP countries is only one side of the activities of the Community; the other is the reform of the social sectors. The Community is increasing its commitments towards the reform of these sectors, mainly through the ‘sector‐wide approach', in coordination with the main European and international donors, setting indicators for follow‐up and performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Support to social and economic actors of civil society is also one of the main characteristics of the Community development cooperation, through NGO cofinancing, decentralised cooperation schemes and micro projects.</p>
<p class="contents">This trend will be improved in the future. The Community Mandate for a new partnership with ACP countries considers the support to social policies, including access to key basic services by the most vulnerable, as one of its main strategic goals, with gender equality and participation of civil society at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes this opportunity to recall the efforts made by the Community and the Member States, within the framework of coordination, in order to strengthen the policy framework on poverty and related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996 there was a Communication on Human and Social Development that followed up several Communications on poverty and social sectors (Poverty 1993, Food Security 1994, Health 1994, Education 1994, Gender 1995). The 1996 Communication set out the links between human and social development and these various issues. These policy statements set out the support to the systems of health and education provision within the context of human and social development, with emphasis on basic services. These are more likely to reach the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">In May 1998 the Commission presented a working paper to the Council on ‘Strengthening actions in the fight against poverty'. On the basis of this, the Council reached certain conclusions. These set the fight against poverty within the framework of the international development targets for economic, human and social development. They requested the Commission to undertake a reflection on specific issues, and this reflection has begun. This includes participation in poverty assessments, studies on the impact of the development cooperation on poverty alleviation, on links between trade and the lives of the poor; guidelines on micro finance at the European level; increased work on gender equality; social funds; policy framework for indigenous people; sector‐wide approach in health and education; focus on poverty alleviation in health, population/AIDS programmes. All these activities are led in coordination with Member States experts. The next October 1999 health expert meeting will deal with health and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as health issues are concerned, the Commission is well aware of the links between health issues and other aspects of human and social development, including education, employment opportunities, gender issues, growth and equity. The Commission does not intend to present a Communication to the Parliament and the Council specifically on this issue. In its former Communications on human and social development, the Commission has already highlighted the links between health and other aspects of human development. In its daily practice, the Commission tries to take these considerations into account in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its aid. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 76 by <span class="bold">Reinhard Rack </span>(H−0129/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Inspection of competition papers by candidates</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the Commission does not allow candidates to inspect competition papers, an approach which, at the very least, does not make for transparency, particularly in cases when participants have failed the tests concerned. Would the Commission be prepared to consider allowing candidates to inspect, or giving them access to copies of, at least those parts of the written tests which involve only ‘true or false' answers, and would the Commission also be prepared to consider revealing to candidates, in respect of some tests, the result they achieved, in terms of a placing by comparison with the best results in each case?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">As it has always pointed out in answers to similar questions, the Commission considers that, in accordance with consistent case‐law, under the competition procedure only the examining board is allowed to assess the merits of the candidates in order to meet the recruitment objectives set out in Article 27 of the Staff Regulations. It was for this purpose that the legislator introduced Article 6 of Annex III of the Staff Regulations establishing the secret nature of the examining board"s work. The correction of the written tests for competitions therefore forms part of the comparative assessment of the candidates" performance, which is to remain secret.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission would like to remind the honourable Member of the special nature of the competition procedure compared with the exam procedure. By their very nature, the competitions involve a comparative exercise. Only the examining board – a special body – has the power to assess the merits of all the candidates: no other person or body, even a judicial body, has the authority to do this. Therefore, it would be of little use to pass on copies of the tests since any assessment by a third party who had not assessed all the other candidates would be irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the Commission does not plan to allow candidates access to these documents. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Food aid to Russia</p>
<p class="contents">Is it true that deliveries of foodstuffs to Russia in the framework of humanitarian aid from the European Union are currently at a standstill owing to the Commission's decision to suspend the tendering procedures?</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission give all necessary details concerning the difficulties of implementing food aid to Russia – which, indeed, were quite foreseeable in the light of that country's very unusual political and administrative structures – and can it confirm that all possible guarantees have been obtained regarding delivery of agricultural products for the benefit of the Russian people at local level?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can inform the honourable Member that the tendering procedure was relaunched on 19 February 1999 with a deadline for tenders of 12 noon on 2 March and a provision for a second deadline of 16 March if no contract could be awarded at the end of the first period. The reason for the suspension of the tenders relates to problems arising from claims from the Russian side, mainly regarding the veterinary/sanitary controls, the quality and presentation of the products, and the transport facilities. These issues were resolved at a meeting between the Commission and the Russian authorities on 17 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The Memorandum of Understanding signed in Moscow on 20 January provided that, before the deliveries of food aid could start, agreement should be reached on a number of the practical details about the monitoring of the distribution in Russia and on the arrangements for the collection, management and subsequent use of the counterpart funds (in roubles) generated by the sale of the food products on the local market in pre‐specified regions. Agreement on these points has now been reached and is contained in a further Memorandum of Understanding which has been signed on 19 February. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Transport safety</p>
<p class="contents">Of the EUR 8.9 m allocated to EU budget heading B−2702 for transport safety in 1999, how much has been or is scheduled to be earmarked for road safety and Euro NCAP?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">For the past years, 60 % to 70 % of the transport safety budget has been allocated to road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The following table gives an overview including the amounts spent for EuroNCAP.</p>
<p class="contents">Amounts in euro million</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously road safety will have to compete against other sectorial priorities. However, it is the Commission's intention to maintain the road safety allocation for the year 1999 at a comparable level.</p>
<p class="contents">EuroNCAP is one of the most successful actions of the past years which the Commission certainly will continue. However, at this stage no precise commitment can be given. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 79 by <span class="bold">Vassilis Ephremidis </span>(H−0137/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Threat of destruction of Lailia forest at Serres by granite quarry</p>
<p class="contents">The decision of the Ministry of Agriculture to grant an operating licence for a granite quarry within 100 000 square metres of public woodland in the district of Serres has provoked an outcry from local residents and organisations. The forest at Lailia forms part of the national register of nature conservation areas and the European Natura 2000 network owing to its exceptional natural beauty and its wealth of flora and fauna, including several rare species; a palaeontological natural museum of vegetation is also being developed in the same area.</p>
<p class="contents">Granting a licence to operate a granite quarry in the area is completely contrary to the decisions designating the area a protected habitat, in which all industrial and mining operations are prohibited. What measures will the Commission, therefore, take to enforce Community legislation, given that the forest is covered by a Community programme to protect the environment and habitats of particular importance, especially in a country such as Greece which has severe problems with the destruction of its forests?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">1 – Any activities carried out in Natura 2000 areas are subject to the conditions provided for in Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#def_1_11" name="ref_1_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a> . Article 6(3), in particular, states that any plan or project likely to have a significant effect on a site of Community importance shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site's conservation objectives, and the decision to give authorisation depends on the results of this assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">2 – The site known as ‘Ori Vrontous‐Lailias" does, in fact, appear under code GR1260007 in the list of proposed sites of Community importance. It was proposed by the Greek authorities for inclusion in the European ecological network, Natura 2000, in accordance with Directive 92/43/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">3 – The site involved is host to priority types of natural habitat and priority species and, according to the criteria laid down in the directive, should automatically be a site of Community importance. Therefore, because it is going to be included in the Natura 2000 network in the future, the conservation status of the site must be preserved and the Member State must, as a result, refrain from taking any steps likely to seriously compromise the site"s integrity. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 80 by <span class="bold">Nikitas Kaklamanis </span>(H−0138/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Omission of Greek islands from euro</p>
<p class="contents">In his reply of 25 January 1999 to my question E−3689/98, Commissioner de Silguy states in regard to the depiction of the islands of Europe on euro coins that the criterion applied was an area of at least 2 500 km2 for the 1 and 2 euro and the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins. However, at least three of the Canary Islands appear on those coins, though none of them is more than 2 500 km2, the largest being Tenerife at 2 053 km2.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is Crete the only Greek island to be depicted on the euro (following endless questions on my part) and when will the main Greek Aegean and Ionian islands finally be included on the new coins?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the representation of islands and archipelagos on euro coins, only islands that have an area greater than 2 500 km<span class="sup">2</span> or archipelagos with an area greater than 5 000 km<span class="sup">2</span> are represented. This criterion was established by taking account of the size of the coins and the technical restrictions involved in striking them. By applying this criterion, the archipelago of the Canary Islands is represented since it has an area of 7 242 km<span class="sup">2</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would remind you that the designs were modified in line with the recommendations of the Member States themselves. The final designs were eventually approved by the ministers of all the Member States at the ECOFIN Council on 17 December 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The representation of Greece and its islands meets the criteria laid down by the ministers and was approved by them. There are therefore no plans to make any further changes to the designs, and production of the coins has begun in most of the Member States on the basis of the approved designs. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 81 by <span class="bold">Ioannis Theonas </span>(H−0145/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Irregularities and problems in implementing optional programmes of study at universities in Greece</p>
<p class="contents">The academic community in Greece is protesting vociferously against the introduction of optional programmes of study which is creating ‘variable‐speed' students and courses, does not guarantee the quality of courses and has to operate in facilities which are already inadequate, as evidenced at the Polytechnic of Crete. The optional programmes of study are to be implemented in Greece – or are already in operation – with Community funding under the Community Support Framework (CSF). In particular, measure 3.1(e) of the third sub‐programme of the operational programme for education and initial vocational training, which is being implemented at the Polytechnic of Crete, is not only meeting with total opposition from teaching staff and students but is alleged to be unlawful and to contain errors and inaccuracies ranging from the formulation of the proposal through to its implementation and the management of the Community funding involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission already disbursed Community funds in connection with the above? Has it investigated the above‐mentioned allegations and what measures will it take in respect of the optional programmes of study to meet the demands of university teachers and students regarding those programmes, with particular reference to the programme at the Polytechnic of Crete?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">'Programmes of Elective Studies' are special educational programmes organised by universities and/or technological institutes in parallel with their conventional programmes. A specific Greek law sets out their objectives and governs their establishment and operation. Since the end of 1997, the European Social Fund has co‐funded a pilot project relating to the support of a number of such programmes, through measures 3.1 of the operational programme ‘Education and Initial Training'.</p>
<p class="contents">Advance payments have been made by the Commission to the Member State for the operational programme as a whole, rather than for specific measures within it. The responsible national authorities then pay the implementing agencies on the basis of the actual progress of the relevant actions and incurred expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">In autumn 1998, responding to a complaint relating to the establishment and operation of the ‘Programme of Elective Studies' organised by the Polytechnic of Crete, the Commission asked the Greek authorities to investigate the issue and to inform it of the results. The Greek authorities are still examining the case and have not yet replied. The Commission will determine its position on the basis of the expected answer and can and will take all necessary steps to ensure the proper use of the Community funds, including an audit of the ‘Programmes of Elective Studies'.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the programme's Monitoring Committee has asked for an evaluation of the ‘Programmes of Elective Studies' at the end of the programming period. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 82 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−0147/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Global solidarity</p>
<p class="contents">1.3 bn of the world's population are living in acute poverty, and the number is increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 the OECD countries' aid to developing countries fell to 0.22 % of GNP. The indications are that it has continued to fall in 1998. The flow of private capital from the industrialised to the under‐developed countries also declined sharply in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations' target is for the wealthy countries to set aside 0.7 % of their GNP for aid. What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that this UN target is met?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced of the need to continue with and increase international public aid to development, which has fallen to its lowest level for decades. As part of the work carried out by the UN on financing development, the Community has also recently reaffirmed its commitment to cooperation as well as its desire to work towards achieving the target of 0.7 % of GNP.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of aid given to third countries through Community and national programmes makes the Community the largest donor of aid. Together, the Member States and the Community donate 56 % of all international public aid. Moreover, several Member States have reached and even exceeded the 0.7 % target. This situation, combined with the important role the Community plays on the international political and economic stage, means that it has a particular responsibility in terms of development.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, the best way to restore some legitimacy to public aid to development and to redeem it in the eyes of the political decision‐makers is to reshape our development cooperation policies. In line with international commitments, this would involve focusing our cooperation efforts on the aim of reducing and eventually eradicating poverty, as well as making it easier for developing countries to progressively participate in the global economy. From this perspective, we ought, in particular, to put greater emphasis on developing the skills of those involved and helping them all to participate in the development process.</p>
<p class="contents">The main responsibility of the developing countries is to implement the political, economic, institutional and sectoral reforms needed to relax the constraints limiting their economic and social development. In this context, the mobilisation of all internal and external resources, be it aid, private investment or revenue from trade, is essential. Such resources have a much greater impact when a number of elements are combined, particularly where there is a political environment that respects human rights and the rule of law, where there is sound management of public affairs and where there are strategies that are successfully aimed at achieving sustainable human development.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the other major international players must make a significant effort to reverse the trend towards decreasing the amount of aid donated, with a view to joining the Community in showing solidarity with the developing countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 83 by <span class="bold">María Sornosa Martínez </span>(H−0151/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Discrimination against an official at the Council on grounds of sexual orientation</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of First Instance recently upheld a Council decision refusing to place stable relationships between same‐sex couples on an equal footing with those between married couples, thereby rejecting the request made to this effect by a Swedish official working at the Council. The judgment by the Court thus fails to take account either of the 1998 amendment to the Council staff regulations, which guarantees equal treatment, or of Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union, which refers to combating discrimination based on sexual orientation. Furthermore, the judgment serves as confirmation of the persistent discrimination encountered by gays and lesbians, a fact which runs counter to the intended spirit of the Treaty on European Union, of which the Council and Commission are supposedly the guardians.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not take the view that additional binding measures such as directives and regulations should be introduced in order to ensure compliance with Article 13 of the EU Treaty within the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The recent amendment to the first article of the Staff Regulations for officials and other employees of the European Communities in April 1998 clarifies and strengthens the Commission"s desire to promote a policy of non‐discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the moment, as regards the allocation of certain benefits and social rights, the Staff Regulations, which were drawn up by the Council, set out a very clear situation which relates to married officials.</p>
<p class="contents">The judgment of the Court of First Instance of 25 January 1999 (T−264/97), to which the honourable Member refers, confirmed the interpretation that these benefits and social rights may not be granted to those who are not married, be they homosexual or heterosexual common law husbands or wives, or even ‘registered couples".</p>
<p class="contents">As the Court pointed out, taking account of those living together in this way, which is regulated and recognised by law in certain Member States, would mean having to amend the text of certain provisions of the Staff Regulations in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent report by the Williamson group on the possible amendments that could be made to modernise the provisions of the Staff Regulations suggests that the problem of ‘registered couples" should be considered by the Commission with a view to possibly recognising it in the future. The Commission has begun to look into this matter and will inform Parliament of the initiatives it plans to take.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Social Action Programme 1998‐2000<a href="#def_1_12" name="ref_1_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> , the Commission announced its intention of exploring the new scope for action opened by Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is working on an Article 13 anti‐discrimination package based on binding legislation supplemented by an action programme, to be presented after the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will ensure that whatever proposals are put forward they take into account issues related to preventing and combating discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Rights of EU staff and their registered partners</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of First Instance of the Court of Justice ruled in a judgment at the beginning of the year that EU officials living in a registered relationship as a couple do not have the same entitlement to family allowances as married couples, despite the fact that the registered couple in the case concerned are from a Member State which gives registered couples equal status with married couples for family allowance purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the Commission is working on a proposal under which the differences in Member States' legislation will have to be taken into account in connection with the rights of EU staff.</p>
<p class="contents">What stage has been reached in this work?</p>
<p class="contents">Is it possible to say at this point whether there will be changes from the interpretation made by the Court of First Instance?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, in terms of the allocation of certain benefits and social rights, the Staff Regulations set out a very clear situation which relates to married officials.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the interpretation that was confirmed by the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 25 January 1999 (T−264/97) to which the honourable Member refers, its provisions cannot be applied to those who are not married, be they homosexual or heterosexual common law husbands or wives, or even ‘registered couples".</p>
<p class="contents">Taking account of those living together in this way, which is regulated and recognised by law in certain Member States, would mean having to amend the text of certain provisions of the Staff Regulations in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent report by the Williamson group on the modernisation of the Staff Regulations suggests that the problem of ‘registered couples" should be considered by the Commission with a view to possibly recognising it in the future. The Commission is currently looking at the possibility of presenting a proposal to that effect, taking account of the legislation in the Member States. It will inform Parliament of the initiatives it plans to take. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 85 by <span class="bold">Astrid Thors </span>(H−0152/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Discriminatory treatment of candidates as a result of errors during the Commission's tests held on 6 February 1999</p>
<p class="contents">It has come to my notice that many of those who took part in Commission competition COM/A/10/98 in Swedish on 6 February were issued with the wrong questions in one of the tests. They were obliged to answer the correct paper after the competition was over for the other participants and had to put up with a great deal of noise, as well as the fatigue resulting from the time added to their tests. They were given no alternative to writing the remaining paper on the spot. There were also mistakes in translation, for example in part A of the Swedish version of COM/A/11‐12/98 (question 34), in which the meaning of the Swedish version of the question differed from that of the other languages.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do to compensate those candidates who suffered from the Commission's own mistakes? Were the same or similar mistakes made in other language versions? Was the same procedure followed in all competition centres as regards those candidates who had to repeat part of the test, and has the Commission identified those responsible for the error?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the mix‐up with the front pages of the Swedish version of test a) on the topics ‘external relations" and ‘managing aid to third countries", COM/A/10/98, required immediate measures in the test centres where Swedish‐speaking candidates – 77 candidates in all – were sitting the tests on one of the two topics in question. This simple mix‐up of the front pages was the only error in the papers for all the 99 different language versions of the tests. The Commission regrets this error.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as the error came to light – around 20 minutes after the beginning of the test – the coordinating unit in Brussels advised all the test centres, and immediate measures were then taken in those centres where Swedish‐speaking candidates were sitting the tests. In 13 of the test centres, an additional 30 minutes was allowed for the candidates involved, with their consent, at the end of the last test. In two centres, the candidates were allowed to do the test during the break at the end of the first part of the tests, once again with their consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that Questions 1 to 15 – out of a total of 40 – were the same for both topics in test a), the additional time allowed for the candidates involved was correct and sufficient to ensure that they received equal treatment. The relatively short duration of the tests – 2 hours and 5 minutes – meant that the candidates should not have become overly tired.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question relating to the Swedish version of Question 34 in one of the specific topics in competition COM/A/11+12/98, we will ask the relevant examining board to look into the matter. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: The Commission's powers and the ECB</p>
<p class="contents">What powers does the Commission have with regard to decisions on the terms of employment of members of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, and how do the ECB's staff regulations otherwise comply with general EU provisions?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no competence in deciding on the terms and conditions of employment of the members of the Executive Board of the ECB. These terms and conditions are fixed by the Governing Council itself on a proposal from a committee comprising three members appointed by the Governing Council and three members appointed by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions of employment including the social security benefits of the ECB staff are laid down by the Governing Council on a proposal of the Executive Board of the ECB. Hence, the staff of the ECB is not covered by the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities. However, the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities is applicable to the members of the Governing Council and to the members of the staff of the ECB; this means in particular that they are liable to the same tax on their salaries as the officials of the other Community institutions. </p>

<p class="contents">There has been widespread astonishment in Finland at the fact that Mrs Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the ECB Executive Board and a former head of the Bank of Finland, receives a special pension in respect of her former job amounting to EUR 10 000 per month over and above her salary. Does the Commission consider that a pension and a salary can be paid simultaneously to Members of the ECB Executive Board? What is the legal justification for this?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no competence in deciding on the terms and conditions of employment of the members of the Executive Board of the ECB. These terms and conditions are fixed by the Governing Council itself on a proposal from a committee comprising three members appointed by the Governing Council and three members appointed by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission has neither a competence in deciding whether pensions which a Board member receives from an earlier occupation in a national central bank should be taken into account in the remuneration, or whether those pensions should not be paid to a Board member. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Breakdown of 1999 EU budget heading B3‐309: Special Annual Events</p>
<p class="contents">In the budget for 1999, Parliament has created heading B3‐309, which is entitled ‘Special Annual Events'. It has been allocated 10 million euros in commitment appropriations and 7 million in payment appropriations and the remarks thereto (as adopted by Parliament itself) read as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">'Each year, the European Union is involved in very notable events (for example European Year Against Racism and Xenophobia, EXPO, exhibitions, etc.) where the active presence of the Union is necessary and desirable, at least through a financial contribution to those activities. This appropriation is intended to finance the Commission's participation to EXPO 2000, which will be held that year in Hanover (...). This appropriation is also intended to finance a European campaign to combat violence against women.'</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we are now approaching the end of February, when is the Commission going to submit to Parliament a breakdown of the budget heading between the two initiatives mentioned? In other words, how much money is the Commission going to allocate to each?</p>
<p class="contents">Which Directorates‐General will be responsible for initiatives funded from this heading?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the remarks to budget Article B3‐309, the Commission is planning to finance two special events concerning information and communication in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the preparation of Expo−2000 in Hanover. Commitments will have to be made in 1999 for hiring the pavilion and for fitting it out. This will require an absolute minimum of EUR 7.5 million, which will be taken from Article B3‐309.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is a large‐scale awareness‐raising campaign about violence against women. The amount agreed so far for this campaign is EUR 3.7 million, of which EUR 2.5 million is to come from Article B3‐309 and the remainder from the general information Article B3‐3000, given the scope for synergy between the two types of operation, and from technical assistance. It should also be added that the Secretariat‐General (Task Force Justice and Home Affairs) and DG V are providing contributions to this operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Several actions are planned, namely two European conferences, a statistical report on violence against women in the Member States, a Eurobarometer survey on the perceptions of violence, the creation of a Web‐site, various publications and the production of a television spot. Support will also be given to projects conducted in the Member States through a call for proposals. Projects supported will primarily be for and about men, in order to prevent violent behaviour against women. A number of events have also already taken place. For example the preparatory conference in June under the British Presidency and the conference organised in Vienna under the Austrian Presidency in October 1998 on the role of the police in the fight of violence against women as well as against migrant women. A white ribbon campaign was launched on 8 March in the European Parliament and will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaign is organised by DG X in cooperation with the Secretariat General (TFJHA) and DG V. DG X is the authorising department for the projects supported under budget lines B3‐309 and B3‐300. </p>

<p class="contents">Can the Commission give an update on the progress of its proposal, submitted to the Council and the European Parliament, for a directive seeking to extend the scope for freedom of establishment within the internal market for professions covered by transitional directives of the kind relating to hairdressers?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission confirm that, once adopted, this proposal will provide for EU‐wide recognition of diplomas for those working in the hairdressing profession, thus going beyond the current directive 82/489/EEC<a href="#def_1_13" name="ref_1_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a> , which simply provides for access to the profession through automatic recognition of professional experience?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council was unable to accept the amendment adopted by Parliament at second reading whereby a migrant worker might opt either for an aptitude test or for a period of training in cases where there was a substantial difference between training courses. Accordingly, a conciliation meeting has been arranged for 18 March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">This Directive will introduce a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications, accompanied by specific guarantees, for hairdressers and other professions not covered by the general system for the recognition of qualifications. It will therefore go beyond the provisions of Directive 82/489/EEC which provides for the recognition of professional experience. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 90 by <span class="bold">Christian Rovsing </span>(H−0156/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Swedish fee for the approval of veterinary certificates</p>
<p class="contents">On the border between Sweden and Denmark, the Swedish authorities levy a SKr 400 fee for the approval of veterinary health and vaccination certificates issued for pets (e.g. cats and dogs) which accompany their owners. This fee must be considered in conjunction with the fees paid to vets for vaccinations and the fee for blood tests payable when an animal first enters the country; taken together, these unusually high charges constitute a financial obstacle for many people who would like to spend some of their free time in Sweden with their four‐legged friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission take the view that the high fee levied by Sweden runs counter to Community law, in particular the rules of the internal market and the rules on the freedom of movement? If so, what action does it propose taking so that the fee is abolished?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions allowing domestic animals – dogs and cats – accompanying travellers to enter Sweden were established by the Swedish authorities in order to protect against rabies since Sweden was itself free of the disease. When Sweden became a member of the Community, we agreed to take account of the situation in Sweden and Finland and to allow them to keep a national regulation that has an effect similar to that in the other Member States that were in the same situation as far as rabies was concerned, namely the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the amount of the levy considered would appear to correspond to the cost of the formal procedures that were implemented to protect Sweden from rabies.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, there are no indications that this Swedish levy contravenes Community law. The Commission will, however, contact the Swedish authorities in order to obtain further information on the matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 91 by <span class="bold">Graham Watson </span>(H−0159/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Regional airports</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is committed to the concept of regionality, and this is key to the provision of air transport links from regional airports to hubs.</p>
<p class="contents">Given current competition rules governing access to hub airports and the lack of financial incentives to provide landing slots for smaller aircraft, is the Commission prepared to consider ways of ensuring slots for links to regional airports such as a mandatory requirement for large airports to provide viable slots for regional use (as is the procedure at Chicago‐O'Hare Airport, which is obliged to earmark 20 % of its allocation in this way?)</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that airlines operating to and from regional airports find it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate slots at congested hub airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Council Regulation No 95/93 on slot allocation<a href="#def_1_14" name="ref_1_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a> allows for the possibility of reserving slots on vital routes to and from regional airports where public service obligations have been imposed under the air transport market access Regulation (No 2408/92).</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the amendment and updating of Regulation 95/93, it is envisaged that such a provision should be retained. Member States would therefore continue to be able to reserve slots in order to ensure services on routes that are considered to be vital for the economic development of a region. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 92 by <span class="bold">Caroline Jackson </span>(H−0160/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: CAP and deer farming</p>
<p class="contents">What is the view of the Commission on the possibility of encouraging deer farming as an alternative to beef production in the EU, by the inclusion of venison in the EU beef scheme so as to provide extra support for deer farmers, and by the inclusion of farmed deer in stocking density calculations in order to end the current abuse of payments being claimed by farmers who farm both suckler cows and deer but nevertheless claim extensification payments?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no intention of creating a specific market organisation for deer. In fact deer are already covered by Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 on the common organisation of the market in certain products listed in Annex II to the EC Treaty. This regulation provides for some basic measures, including the application of customs duties to imports from third countries, a safeguard clause and the application of competition rules foreseen by the Treaty of Rome. In addition, investments in deer farming may in principle also be funded under Regulation (EC) No 950/97 of 20 May 1997 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures, provided that the conditions for investment aid are respected. Similarly, other structural aid may be envisaged within the framework of regional programmes under Objective 1 or Objective 5b.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the question of including deer in the stocking density calculations, the Commission decided some time ago which sectors were in need of urgent reform and, therefore, there was no proposal to include this type of farming in the Agenda 2000 proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to refer to its proposal concerning ‘rural development' integrated in the package ‘Agenda 2000'. According to this proposal, compensatory allowances for less‐favoured areas (LFA) will be calculated on a hectarage basis without referring to special categories of animals reared in these areas. Consequently, deer farming may indirectly benefit from this change for compensatory allowances in the less‐favoured areas. However areas benefiting from compensatory allowances must be managed in a way respecting the needs of environmental protection and avoiding any overstocking. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 93 by <span class="bold">Alexandros Alavanos </span>(H−0164/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Öcalan case and the Kurdish problem</p>
<p class="contents">In its capacity as guardian of the Treaties with responsibility for ensuring proper compliance with the Treaties and European Union decisions, will the Commission say how it judges the obstructive policies pursued by the Member States and their basic refusal to grant political asylum to the Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan in accordance with the Council resolutions and decisions on applications for the granting of asylum (Council Resolution of 20 June 1995, Agreement 97/C 254/01)?</p>
<p class="contents">What pressure will it exert on Turkey to ensure that the Kurdish leader receives a fair and public trial and that his life is spared? Does it intend to take initiatives to convoke an international conference to find a solution to the Kurdish problem?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Treaties as they stand at the moment, the Commission has no authority to examine whether or not Member States are respecting laws on the right of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last General Affairs Council, the European Union adopted a declaration on the Öcalan affair highlighting the importance the Union attaches to a fair trial. This means both that the defendant should be treated correctly and that the trial should be in public before an independent court. The Union"s declaration also stresses the importance of allowing the PKK leader free access to lawyers of his choice and of allowing foreign observers to attend the trial. The Commission fully supports this declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the ongoing situation in south‐east Turkey, the European Union also emphasised once again in its declaration how vital it was to look for political solutions and to promote reconciliation. It stated that it was prepared to contribute to these efforts, particularly by continuing to provide financial assistance. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 94 by <span class="bold">Marianne Eriksson </span>(H−0167/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Aid to Morocco</p>
<p class="contents">Is it the case that Morocco receives annual EU aid of $US 280 million while at the same time spending $US 365 million on occupying Western Sahara in contravention of the UN Charter and international law? If it is, does the Commission intend to withdraw or reduce this EU aid to Morocco in the foreseeable future?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1996, Morocco has received aid amounting to an average of EUR 140 million each year from the Community budget to fund development projects and programmes approved by the Member States in the context of the association agreement between the EC and Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">The Western Sahara issue comes under a process that is directly monitored by the United Nations. The European Union has on many occasions, and most recently in the declaration by the presidency of 29 December 1998, expressed its full support for the settlement plan proposed by the Secretary‐General of the United Nations, the aim of which is to ensure a free, legitimate and impartial referendum on self‐determination for the people of Western Sahara. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 95 by <span class="bold">Jörn Svensson </span>(H−0168/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Working conditions for interpreters</p>
<p class="contents">It has come to my knowledge that the freelance interpreters have not been paid since October 1998. Is the Commission prepared to pay them what is due up till today's date without delay? During the new negotiations in progress is it prepared to recognise the AIIC (International Association of Conference Interpreters) as a negotiating partner?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">1) As of 15 February 1999, as regards the Joint Interpreting and Conference Service (JICS), all the freelance interpreters used by the JICS who duly submitted complete invoices were paid. Repeated contact was made with those involved to finalise incomplete forms.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the interpreters managed by DG IX in Luxembourg and used by all the institutions in Luxembourg, advance payments – representing 80 % of estimated costs – were made for all missions carried out before 15 February 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The delay in the payment of the invoices is due to the implementation of new procedures linked to the introduction of new computer systems and their interfaces.</p>
<p class="contents">Two sets of invoices were paid by the Commission on Tuesday, 2 March, and others will follow in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">2) The AIIC (International Association of Conference Interpreters) is participating in the negotiations to renew the convention with other associations representing conference interpreters. These negotiations, which are ongoing, are being held between the institutions and the negotiating delegation of conference interpreters. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 96 by <span class="bold">Anne Van Lancker </span>(H−0170/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Following up requests from Parliament to the Commission concerning the problems of frontier workers</p>
<p class="contents">In its answer to my question H−1161/98 of December 1998<a href="#def_1_15" name="ref_1_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a> the Commission said that it was consulting Member States on changes to be made to legislation concerning frontier workers and that it did not feel there was any need to submit proposals. It also said that tax conventions were not its responsibility. Commissioner Monti has subsequently received a letter from Mr Viseur, Belgian Minister of Finance, requesting a Commission initiative to create greater coherence between the principles underlying tax and social security systems. In its resolution of 28 May 1998 Parliament called on the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the effect of double taxation agreements between Member States, and to undertake research into the advantages and disadvantages of the country‐of‐residence principle, the country‐of‐employment principle, combinations of the two and the option of choosing one or the other. Parliament urged the Commission to seek a Community solution to the problems of frontier workers caused by interaction between tax systems and social security systems. How has the Commission responded to these requests by the European Parliament, and by the Belgian Minister of Finance? When can we expect the studies that have been requested?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Before carrying out more detailed studies on the fiscal status of frontier workers and on the current interaction between the fiscal and social security systems affecting these workers – as Parliament requested in its resolution of 28 May 1998 – the Commission plans to submit these questions to the ‘fiscal policy group", a group of personal representatives of the finance ministers, chaired by the Commissioner responsible for taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate within that group should allow us to determine if there is a political will on the part of the Member States to harmonise the fiscal status of frontier workers. The interaction between taxation and social security should also be taken into consideration during the discussions. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 97 by <span class="bold">Anne McIntosh </span>(H−0172/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Pigmeat subsidies</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of the Commission finding evidence of unfair subsidies in the pigmeat sector in Member States, will it consider using an alternative instrument rather than action in the European Court of Justice against these Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">When investigating allegations of unlawful State aid, the Commission is bound to respect the procedural rules laid down by Article 93 of the EC Treaty, which safeguard the rights of defence of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may adopt a decision finding that incompatible State aid has been paid and ordering the Member State to recover this aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice in the Boussac case, the Commission may, in case of urgency, also adopt interim decisions ordering a Member State to suspend the payment of illegal aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In the agricultural sector, the Commission may also deduct the amount of any illegal aid from payments which are made to the Member State concerned under the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund (EAGGF).</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers the use of these powers carefully in all cases where it has evidence of the illegal payment of State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it should be emphasised that in accordance with the principle of the rule of law, all Commission decisions in the field of State aid are subject to judicial review by the Court of Justice. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 98 by <span class="bold">Maren Günther </span>(H−0175/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Controls on the use of Phare resources in Romania</p>
<p class="contents">What controls does the Commission employ to ensure that resources intended to fund restructuring in the mining sector are used effectively?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission guarantee that no Phare resources were used to fund the protests by miners (for example, for transporting demonstrators)?</p>
<p class="contents">What appropriations has the Commission allocated as part of the Europe Agreement with Romania to re‐equip the police and why were the latter not given special equipment to safeguard public order in this instance?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Romanian miners' union receive any Phare funds?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Under the 1998 Phare catch‐up facility, 10 million euro have been allocation to the Mining Area Reconstruction Fund (MARR), providing support to the Jiu and Gorj valleys. The programme is in the process of starting.</p>
<p class="contents">In previous years Phare allocated 0, 85 million euro under the 1995 Phare Energy Programme for the creation of alternative employment in the Jiu Valley. According to the first assessments, over 750 new jobs have been created under this allocation. The Commission has undertaken an evaluation of this employment scheme under its internal evaluation. The results of the evaluation should be available in the first semester of 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The Delegation of the Commission in Romania organises monthly meetings with counterparts on each of the Phare programmes. A regular contact with counterparts and regular progress monitoring is thereby ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Phare funds are allocated on the basis of detailed programme and project descriptions. The type of expenditure permitted under each project is clearly stipulated. The Commission can therefore exclude that Phare funds have been used in connection with protest activities by miners.</p>
<p class="contents">The sound implementation of programmes is checked by the Commission on the basis of regular progress reports and meetings with the counterpart organisation. Before a programme is closed down, the Commission's internal assessment unit sends an evaluation mission to scrutinise the programme in question. This includes payments. As a matter of principle, other relevant Commission services and the European Court of Auditors have access to all Phare related files.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, Phare funds for the procurement of police equipment have not been allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the national Phare programme, funds are neither allocated nor foreseen to be allocated for the mine workers trade unions in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the horizontal Lien/Democracy programme, there are currently 5 projects supported in Romania, but none of them is connected to the mining dispute. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 99 by <span class="bold">Mark Killilea </span>(H−0177/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: New Community Initiative on Human Resources</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the NOW Programme (New Opportunities for Women) is to disappear at the end of this year, can the Commission state whether the new Community Initiative on human resources will have a gender‐specific orientation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000, where it speaks of Community Initiatives, states clearly that, in the next programming period of the Structural Funds, there will be three Initiatives, including one relating to ‘human resources, paying special attention to equal opportunities'.</p>
<p class="contents">This new Initiative will provide a framework for innovative development of policy and practice designed to create labour markets which are free of discrimination, in line with the European Employment Strategy agreed at the Luxembourg European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Employment Strategy has a very clear gender‐specific orientation, with one pillar devoted to strengthening policies on equal opportunities, and with the commitment to mainstream equal opportunities within the other three pillars, in line with the Commission's commitment to incorporate equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The programmes submitted by the Member States under the proposed new human resource Community Initiative will, therefore, be required to demonstrate clearly that they include, as a priority, actions to promote equal opportunities between women and men, and that actions proposed relating to the other pillars take the gender dimension into account. Given the repeated commitments made by the Commission to tackle the problem of gender inequality, the Commission will ensure that all proposed national programmes under the new Community Initiative include these priorities before it accepts them. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 100 by <span class="bold">Gerard Collins </span>(H−0183/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: WTO obligations and trade with the US in milk and dairy products</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that trade in milk products is not a major issue for the US within the WTO and that, this being the case, pressure to reform the EU milk sector is not coming from any major market problem? Would it not then be a feasible strategy from the point of view of relations with our US trading partner, for the EU to defer milk reform for a few years until the WTO outcome is clarified and to concede the minimum level of price cut necessary to make a ‘reasonable ‘offer in the WTO round?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the discussions on the reform of the Community milk policy, the Commission has emphasised the multiple challenges that justify this reform. The Community's position in the WTO negotiations is one of these challenges and one that is fully relevant for the milk sector. On a more general level, it is important for the Community to reinforce its negotiation position before the start of the next WTO round. This can only be achieved if a reform of the common agricultural policy in depth is accomplished, which means that an important sector such as milk cannot be left aside.</p>
<p class="contents">But the challenges facing the milk sector are first and foremost internal in nature. If there is a will to improve the competitiveness of the dairy sector on the internal market, the measures proposed in Agenda 2000 represent the strict minimum to achieve this target.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, an unchanged milk policy would be an obstacle on the road to the future expansion of the Community. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 101 by <span class="bold">Bernd Posselt </span>(H−0188/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Action against the PKK</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission taken an initiative for an EU‐wide ban on the PKK and for a common policy against this terrorist organisation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In its regular report on the progress made by Turkey along the path to accession, adopted on 4 November, the Commission examined the current situation in south‐east Turkey, stressing in particular the need to find a civil rather than a military solution. It also emphasised the negative effects of the war between the Turkish authorities and the PKK, which has been going on for more than 10 years. The report further highlighted both the use of terrorist methods by the PKK and the violations of human rights by the Turkish security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last General Affairs Council, the European Union reiterated its condemnation of all forms of terrorism, adding that legitimate interests should be expressed through political channels rather than through violence. On this subject, the Commission report of 4 November had stated that ‘a civil solution could include recognition of certain forms of Kurdish cultural identity and greater tolerance of the ways of expressing that identity, provided it does not advocate separatism or terrorism".</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is important to note that the German Presidency organised an informal meeting on 23 February 1999 with several interior ministers from the EU and from Switzerland, in which the Commission also participated. It was designed to provide a forum for exchanging information on the PKK and to consider certain joint policing measures aimed at combating possible future illegal activities by the PKK. The German Presidency plans to address this issue during the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 27 May. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 102 by <span class="bold">Niall Andrews </span>(H−0189/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Hidden dangers of salt</p>
<p class="contents">A study of over 10 000 people in 32 countries found a positive association between salt intake and blood pressure and according to medical trials, reducing the intake of salt can lead to significantly reduced blood pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Salt is used to transform the taste of food and bread is the single largest source of dietary salt.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission propose to raise public consciousness about dietary salt?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Diet, together with physical activity, is a key health determinant and is therefore one of the priorities of the Community action programme on health promotion, education, information and training.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community acknowledges that some nutritional issues such as salt intake are debated in the scientific community, and is therefore supporting a European project on nutrition and diet for healthy lifestyles in Europe. The project is coordinated by the University of Crete and will look into the role of a number of nutrients, including salt, in a healthy diet. The Commission has chosen this approach because there is a need to look at diet in general rather than single products. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 103 by <span class="bold">James Fitzsimons </span>(H−0193/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: European safety standard for riding helmets</p>
<p class="contents">According to recent figures on accidents involving horse riders in Ireland which have been established by the ESRI, approximately 600 accidents involve hospitalisation and 28 % to 30 % of such accidents result in brain damage and/or concussion.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures illustrate the urgency of ensuring that the best possible standard for riding helmets is introduced throughout the European Union. Such a standard is available through European Standard (EN 1384). It is capable of passing any world riding helmet standard.</p>
<p class="contents">When will the Commission finally agree to put safety first and introduce this standard for riding helmets?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been made aware on several occasions of the problem involving the safety of helmets for horse riders and acknowledges the urgent need for the problem to be regulated so that the safety of horse riders may be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Helmets constitute personal protection equipment and are covered by Directive 89/686/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission gave the CEN a mandate to draw up a harmonised standard conferring assumption of compliance with the basic health and safety requirements laid down by the Directive. That standard (EN 1384) ‘Helmets for equestrian activities' was adopted in September 1996 and its reference published in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 14 June 1997<a href="#def_1_16" name="ref_1_16"><sup>(16)</sup></a> .</p>
<p class="contents">Since publication, which confers on the standard the assumption that it complies with the Directive's requirements, the official bodies notified take that standard as the basis for their approval, although they are not obliged to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Since he felt that some aspects of the EN 1384 standard might be improved, Mr Downes submitted a petition seeking to improve the safety of helmets for equestrian activities. The Commission is fully behind this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Standards are laid down by European standardisation bodies which are private bodies on which the Commission has no possibility of exerting direct influence. However, it has expressly asked CEN/TC 158, which is responsible for this standard, to review at the earliest possible date the substance of the characteristics required for helmets for equestrian activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The CEN/TC 158 Technical Committee and its relevant working party welcomed this request and immediately took action to respond thereto.</p>
<p class="contents">The CEN/TC 158 WG 5 specialist working party met on 14 October 1998 in order to review the substance of this standard. The petitioner and a representative of consumers' associations also attended the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">A meeting was held on 3 March 1999. It is expected that the findings thereof will be forwarded to the Commission at an early date. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 104 by <span class="bold">Karin Riis‐Jørgensen </span>(H−0196/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Initiatives to restore confidence in animal proteins</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the BSE conference held on 30 November and 1 December 1998, could the Commission make an official statement on the present risks relating to BSE?</p>
<p class="contents">The feed and food industry is still in a state of great uncertainty, both in the EU and third countries, which has resulted in almost anarchic market conditions for animal products.</p>
<p class="contents">What initiatives has the Commission taken, or will it take, with a view to restoring confidence in animal proteins produced in the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission observed a favourable development of the BSE epidemic in the United Kingdom and Switzerland over the past twelve months. Over the same period the occurrence in Belgium, France and the Netherlands was low and in Ireland higher but not increasing. On the contrary, the BSE occurrence in Portugal increased steeply. Although the BSE situation appears under control in some regions, the increased presence of the agent in other regions, and the scientific advice that BSE in small ruminants can not be excluded, does not allow the Commission to relax its precautionary approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest uncertainty for the food and feed industries appears to arise from the various national regimes for the elimination of animal tissues posing the highest risk of spreading the TSE agent. It is important to note that the fifth attempt of the Commission to harmonise these rules taking account of the geographic risk was last December again rejected by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 1998 the Commission sent the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation laying down rules for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (COM(98) 623 fin.) to the European Parliament and Council. By laying down rules for all aspects of public and animal health, based on international standards and scientific evidence, this proposal aims at ensuring a very high level of consumer protection and the continued restoration of public confidence in animal protein manufactured in the Community. Where necessary, the Commission will continue to propose interim measures, derived from the above proposal and until its coming into force. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 105 by <span class="bold">Brian Crowley </span>(H−0199/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU support for the family</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission state how it intends to better integrate family policy into the following: employment, social protection, consumption (postal services, gas, electricity), combating disability, education and training and public health and housing?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">There is no Community competence on family policy and, therefore, Member States are free to regulate this area according to their national legislation. However, the Community has a long‐standing commitment to supporting the reconciliation of work and family responsibilities and a considerable body of legal and policy instruments have been developed to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of reconciling work with family life has been a focus of the equal opportunities pillar included in the Guidelines for Member States' Employment Policies since 1998 and this has been further strengthened in those for 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's Communication on modernising and improving social protection in the EU (COM(97) 102) identifies as a major priority the need to adapt social protection systems to developments in family structures. Key points for the Commission's ongoing consultation and reflection with Member States include the impact on social security rights of career breaks for child or elder care, the possible impact of means‐testing of family benefits on the incentive to take up employment and the importance of childcare provision for families.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of legislative measures, the directives on maternity (92/85), on parental leave (96/34) and on part‐time work (97/81) should be considered as important means for better reconciling family and work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds have also funded childcare services and have supported training for child‐care workers in particular under the Employment‐NOW initiative. Moreover, measures aiming at improving reconciliation between work and family life are part of the proposals for the new Structural Funds regulations for 2000‐2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important policy instruments include the current Medium‐term Community Action Programme on equal opportunities for women and men (1996‐2000) which identifies reconciliation of work and family life as one of its objectives and provides financial support for exchange of information and good practice. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 106 by <span class="bold">Jan Bertens </span>(H−0205/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Commission's annual report on the implementation of human rights policy and the relevant budget headings</p>
<p class="contents">Up to and including 1995 the Commission had the excellent custom of drawing up an annual report on the implementation of the budget headings relating to human rights. This was an extremely useful instrument for the European Parliament, and is sorely missed.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has the Commission not drawn up any such reports since then?</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend to effectively inform and consult the European Parliament on the implementation of human rights policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that no annual report on the ‘human rights" budget headings in Chapter B7‐70 has been drawn up since 1996. This is due to the lack of suitable personnel and the excessive workload in the department responsible for coordinating and preparing the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">However, every year Parliament has been systematically informed about the implementation of each budget heading in the general report on the implementation of the Community budget and specific reports such as that presented by the Commissioner responsible at the beginning of the year to the President of the European Parliament and the chairmen of the relevant parliamentary committees. The report on financial activities in 1998 was delivered on 3 March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">A report on the implementation in 1996 and 1997 of the Council resolution on human rights, democracy and development, adopted on 28 November 1991, will be available in May.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is preparing to draw up an overall report by the end of 1999 on the implementation of the ‘human rights" budget headings in Chapter B7‐70 for the period 1996‐1998. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Management of the Leonardo da Vinci programme</p>
<p class="contents">During Parliament's part‐session in November 1998, reference was made to the mismanagement of the portfolios held by Mrs Cresson. Another issue raised was the mismanagement of the Leonardo da Vinci programme run by a private concern named Agenor. The debate revealed that Mrs Cresson had requested changes in the management of the agency and, among other things, the replacement of the director, Mr Richard Walther. On 11 February 1999, the Commission wrote to Agenor to terminate its contract, leaving approximately 70 workers unemployed. Will the Commission say whether it was Mrs Cresson's intention that the director should be replaced or that all the workers should lose their jobs? What measures will the Commission take to ensure that the workers receive the compensation to which they are entitled and, finally, what measures will it take to ensure that the staff who wish to continue with the administration of the programme are taken on by the new management?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In the management of the Leonardo da Vinci programme the Commission was assisted by a technical assistance office (TAO) set up by Agenor; the assistance was provided by means of successive contracts, the last of which was due to end on 31 January 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the results of the audit of the TAO carried out by the Commission"s financial controller, it would only have been possible to renew the contract with Agenor after 31 January 1999 if the Commission had felt that radical improvements in the management of the office would prevent the problems identified from recurring.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, a letter had been sent to Agenor at the beginning of January setting out the conditions required for renewal of the contract, including the restructuring of the TAO. In addition, in reply to a letter of 13 January 1999 from Mr Hughes, the chairman of Parliament"s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Commissioner responsible had organised a meeting on 19 January with the director of Agenor and representatives of Parliament to examine what measures were needed to restore confidence and a good working relationship between the Commission and Agenor. At the meeting the director of Agenor announced, among other things, that the manager of the TAO was to leave.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite several meetings and discussions between the Commission and Agenor, the changes announced did not take place. The Commission was therefore forced to conclude that the conditions had not been met for the contract to be renewed and that contractual relations had ended on 31 January 1999. It is up to Agenor to deal with the consequences arising from the non‐renewal of the contract.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has decided to manage the programme itself from now on; the technical assistance will not be taken over by another group. To this end DG XXII, which is responsible for the programme, is to take on extra auxiliary and temporary staff. People who are familiar with the Leonardo programme are likely to be given favourable consideration here, though still in accordance with the institution"s rules. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Nuts regional classification – Ireland</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission state why the application for the subdivision of Ireland into two Nuts II regions has been rejected by Eurostat and has the Commission received notification of the submission of an amended application by the Irish Government for the designation of a different area?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons why the application by Ireland for a modification of the NUTS nomenclature has been rejected have been detailed in a letter to the Irish Central Statistical Office.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the NUTS 3 level, it was explained that in 1994 Eurostat had already accepted a significant reform. Just five years later, it was now proposed to undertake a further major reorganisation at that level, with the boundaries of two existing NUTS regions being breached in order to include Clare and Kerry in a new region called Western Seaboard. If it is the case that the Western Seaboard of Ireland offers a particularly homogenous territorial entity, such a situation has not arisen only since 1994. Given that the identification of the Western Seaboard in the NUTS structure was not considered of sufficient importance to be included in the 1994 reform, there would seem to be no basis for accepting it now. When one also bears in mind the importance attached by all statistics users to the stability of the nomenclatures used, it is the Commission's view that the existing classification should be retained.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the NUTS 2 level, it was clear that the powers of the new regional authorities proposed at that level would almost exclusively concern management of the Structural Funds. The NUTS, however, is a statistical nomenclature. It was primarily established for the collection and the dissemination of regional statistics at Community level. Its overall objective is not to be a tool for the management of the Structural Funds, and the community of users of regional statistics is larger than those involved in the management of Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, given the hierarchical structure of the NUTS nomenclature, it was not possible to accept a breakdown at NUTS 2 level not compatible with the current NUTS 3, as the proposal for a new NUTS 3 level was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, the Commission has not received any amended application by the Central Statistical Office. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 109 by <span class="bold">Nuala Ahern </span>(H−0214/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU rainforest policy and local communities</p>
<p class="contents">The Rainforest Foundation from the United Kingdom released in September last year a well researched and very worrying report, entitled ‘Out of Commission' about the EU's development assistance programme in tropical forest regions. It concludes that despite a certain number of very positive EU funded projects a large number of them still appear to be damaging the rainforest environment and harming local communities. Social and ecological impact studies are rarely made before development projects are approved despite procedural obligation for the Commission to do so and Commission staff lack time and relevant expertise in social and environmental matters. Does the Commission agree that there is a need for a major effort to achieve improvements in the implementation of its own internal management guidelines and policy on the preservation of tropical rainforests and the protection of local forest communities? Can the Commission provide an update on progress made in this matter and concrete plans to improve this situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is fully aware of the project examples highlighted in the brochure of the Rainforest Foundation. Indeed, most of the essential information was extracted from the Commission's own evaluation reports. The projects referred to were mainly prepared in the 80's and executed in the early 90's.</p>
<p class="contents">As a response to these experiences and the recommendations of the evaluation reports the Commission has continuously improved its project preparation procedures. In 1993, the Project Cycle Management Manual and the Environment Manual were introduced. In 1996, the Quality Support Group was created. In addition, sectoral guidelines have been prepared for various development cooperation sectors, notably the Forest and Sustainable Development Guidelines in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to bring this continuous learning process forward, two evaluations on the environmental performance of EC cooperation (December 1997) and tropical forests (July 1998) have been conducted which show that progress has been made. At the same time, areas for further improvement were identified.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the results of the evaluation on the environmental performance, the Commission has identified steps in June 1998 in order to ensure that environmental assessments are conducted as required. In 1999, the priority actions will include a new training programme for ACP‐ALA‐MED and EC officials in environment assessments, the review of the environment assessment procedures, improved transparency through publicly accessible information on the process and the results of environment assessments, and the creation of an Environment Integration Help Desk which has been functioning since mid‐January.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for the future, the Commission envisages wider internal and external consultations on various subjects of development cooperation. This year, it has already included discussions with stakeholders on the EC policy approach towards forests and development, towards poverty and environment. In January 1999, the Commission presented to the Council and the EP proposals for renewed Council regulations concerning environmental aspects of development cooperation and forest sector development, in order to assure the continuity of these financing instruments from the year 2000 onwards. A major difference with the actually valid regulations from 1995 and 1997 covering these respective fields of action is that the EC has proposed specific measures to enable it to pay increased attention to both project preparation and execution. During the second quarter of 1999, the new environment assessment guide will also be circulated widely in order to gather the views of the various actors in development cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 110 by <span class="bold">Hugh Kerr </span>(H−0219/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Follow‐up of the Commission working document and the Council resolution on policy on indigenous peoples in development cooperation</p>
<p class="contents">In the past year the European Commission held a seminar meeting about indigenous peoples policy in developing countries in Spring 1998. It then adopted the working document (SEC(1998)773 fin.) in May, and finally, the Council on Development adopted a resolution on 30 November 1998. The ministers instructed an expert group on social development to discuss the implementation of the proposed actions and to make further proposals. Who nominates the members of the expert group, who sets its agenda, what is the formal status of this expert group and what has this group done since November? Is the indigenous policy on the agenda for its next meetings? Have they or are they intending to invite indigenous representatives and NGOs to participate in these debates? What are the priority actions in this field that the Commission is focusing on for this year? Is it formulating an action programme, or what are the next policy steps the Commission intends to develop?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council resolution of 30 November 1998 provided for the issues relating to the implementation of the action plan proposed in the working document (SEC(1998) 773 fin.) to be submitted for consideration to a group of experts in social development.</p>
<p class="contents">That group, which consists of experts in social development from the Member States, has no formal status, and its agenda is drawn up on the basis of priorities and of the recommendations resulting from the Council's work and its resolutions. The group met in March 1998 to discuss indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">A further meeting is scheduled to be held in April 1999. Among the items on the agenda might be the action taken (or to be taken) on the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the Commission took an immediate action on this resolution by implementing a programme of four projects, beginning in January 1999 and costing EUR 2 537 235, funded from Item B7‐7020. The main objective of these projects is to strengthen the capacity of the associations of indigenous peoples. One of the projects also involves the setting‐up of ten regional studies to be carried out by experts who are themselves members of these indigenous peoples. One aim of those studies will be the definition of specific regional characteristics and the drafting of recommendations for action aimed at the various providers of funds in the field of development cooperation. They will also be designed to establish a kind of world map of such peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">A list of priority topics for action is being drawn up as part of the management of resources earmarked to ensure respect for and the promotion of human rights, and they include the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plans to draw up, before the end of March 1999, specific proposals designed to incorporate the issue of indigenous peoples at the various levels of development cooperation, as called for in the relevant resolution adopted by the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 111 by <span class="bold">Eva Kjer Hansen </span>(H−0221/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Preferential trade agreement with New Zealand</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of December, the WTO panel in Geneva on preferential imports of butter from New Zealand ruled against the EU, as New Zealand spreadable butter was to be accepted as being covered by the preferential arrangements. This was despite the fact that the EU had formulated clear rules stipulating that spreadable butter was not to be covered by the agreement in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission state whether the ruling is incompatible with normal legal practice in international trade disputes, as it is a broad and flexible interpretation of the agreement that is at the centre of this dispute? Will it also state whether or not legal practice in such matters is to base decisions on a narrow and restrictive interpretation?</p>
<p class="contents">Will it therefore also state whether and on what grounds it intends or does not intend to appeal against this decision?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO panel has completed its report but has not yet published it. Following informal discussions with the Commission, New Zealand has asked for publication to be held up for four weeks to allow time for both parties to assess the implications of the draft report and, if possible, to arrive at an amicable solution. Although no definitive decision has been reached, at first sight it would appear that there would be advantages from both sides in such an approach. From the Community side, the advantage is that it would avoid certain interpretations of the rights and responsibilities of importers and exporters in cases such as this becoming part of WTO case law and, from the New Zealand side, it would offer a rapid resolution of their complaint against us. </p>
