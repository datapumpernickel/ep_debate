<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, as you said yourself, the report concerns a Commission proposal on the transport of dangerous goods by rail. In recent years, this transport has expanded considerably, thus increasing the risks of accidents occurring. The international transport of dangerous goods by rail is governed by the regulations concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail, usually known as RID. All the Member Sates are contracting parties to this Convention whose geographical scope extends beyond the European Union. This Convention only applies to cross-border transport and does not cover the national carriage of dangerous goods by rail. Therefore, and in order to ensure a high level of safety for national and international transport operations and to guarantee the elimination of distortions of competition, the European Union has adopted Directive 96/49/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail. </p>
<p class="contents">The main purpose of this Community legislation is to extend the above-mentioned regulations concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail (RID) to national transport, i.e., to transport operations within the national territory of each Member State. </p>
<p class="contents">The aforementioned directive entered into force in January 1997. However, this directive provided for a certain number of derogations, restrictions and exemptions. In particular, transitional provisions expiring on 1 January 1999 relating to the construction, use and conditions of carriage of new tanks and new receptacles for the transport of gas, allowed Member States to retain the provisions of their national legislation. The reason was that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) had not yet completed work to standardise the construction and use of tanks and receptacles. </p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal aims to extend the aforementioned transitional period until 1 July 2001, or even longer for the transportation of pressure equipment for which no detailed technical specifications or no adequate references to the relevant European standards exist. In this case, the date of entry into force of the provisions of the directive is to be determined by the Committee set up on the basis of the directive. The reason for the postponement is that, due to delays in the standardisation work being carried out by the European Committee for Standardisation, the 1999 version of the RID does not incorporate standards for the construction and use of tanks and receptacles for transporting Class 2 gases. </p>
<p class="contents">The second objective of the present proposal is to amend certain provisions in Article 6 concerning derogations and to specify their acceptance procedure in more detail. In particular, it aims to define the conditions that must be met for the application of certain derogations authorising Member States, as an exceptional measure, to issue administrative authorisations valid on their territory alone to carry out “ad hoc” transport operations of dangerous goods. </p>
<p class="contents">The general public takes a great interest in the transport of dangerous goods and measures relating to such transport. Ensuring quality and safety standards in the carriage of goods by rail must be the main objective of any EU legislation in this field. </p>
<p class="contents">The key problem is that standards for the construction and use of tanks and receptacles for transporting Class 2 gases have not yet been agreed by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN). In all Member States, there are various provisions in industrial and transport law concerning the packing and transportation of these gases. The national regulations can be very different, in particular on technical grounds and also for climatic reasons, which leads to a fragmentation of the market within the EU which is incompatible with the single market. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore difficult to explain to the general public why the necessary common European standards have not yet been incorporated into the Annex to the EU legislation. This is the reason why I cannot welcome this Commission proposal. I understand, however, the need to extend the deadlines in Directive 96/49, in order to preclude the need for Member States to amend their national legislation for a brief period, entailing extra expenditure for the Member States and industry. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second part of the proposal specifying the conditions on which a transport operation can be considered an “ad hoc” transport operation and also regarding the procedure for the acceptance of derogations, I personally welcome and approve the Commission proposal which is, in fact, more stringent than the legislation in force today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transport safety in all transport operators has always been an important matter of concern to Parliament, particularly, of course, in the transportation of dangerous goods.</p>
<p class="contents">The annoying thing about the matter before us is that the CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, is extremely dilatory. We therefore find ourselves in the situation of having to concede an extension to the time limit for, as the rapporteur said, it would be senseless if all Member States were now going to have to issue further individual regulations for a set period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need common regulations which are as strict as possible, also for the transportation of dangerous goods. Consequently, one can only fully endorse the proposal of the rapporteur, our committee chairman, and also thank him for the work which he inevitably took on himself. This would have been superfluous if the other authorities had completed their work in good time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that the general population and the personnel working in this sector are being subjected to ever greater risk, and this is due to a number of reasons. Firstly, the privatisation of rail networks, particularly in all matters to do with their maintenance, presents serious problems for safety, with an increasing number of accidents occasionally causing real disasters in human terms, such as we have just seen in Great Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to make profits and competitivity are enshrined in European standards. They demand drastic reductions in costs, always to the detriment of the employees who nonetheless play an essential part in the field of maintenance and safety. This is done without any supervision. Neither officials, nor users, nor citizens are called upon to give their opinion. The diversity of the legislation within each State further complicates safety matters and increases the risk factor. As far as we are concerned, it is important for the principle of precaution and of maximum safety to have priority. This is true, particularly for the transportation of radioactive waste, which is dealt with in France with intolerable insouciance, particularly in the case at The Hague, with little respect for the health of railway workers and the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, then, it is a matter of urgency to put an end to privatisation, to increase staff levels, and to give these people proper training, to enforce compulsory budgets reserved for the maintenance and supervision thereof, to set up user/professional committees to supervise traffic, to enforce an official right of veto with regard to goods transfers when real risks are involved. This would make it possible to take preventative action rather than waiting for accidents to happen, as they will, more and more, if no action is taken involving the authorities and the general public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The risk of accidents has increased concurrently with the growth in the number of consignments of this kind in recent years. I myself have experienced at close quarters a rail accident involving dangerous goods. A few years ago, a goods wagon containing poison overturned in my home town of Næstved, with catastrophic consequences. The dangerous liquid poured out. If there had been a powerful wind, thousands of people could have been poisoned. It was so serious that the team which cleared the track after the accident was clothed in what looked like space suits, which almost began to melt. I am therefore very glad that we in the EU are making a point of enforcing some very high standards in connection with this kind of transport. </p>
<p class="contents">The present directive states that the international regulations in this sphere also apply to transport within the individual Member States. Unfortunately, it was necessary to have a number of exceptions because the European experts had not finished drawing up standards for the transport of gas. The Member States were therefore given permission to keep their national regulations for a transitional period. The experts have still not completed their work, and the transitional arrangements ought therefore to be extended. I therefore think that we shall be voting for the report. In fact, it secures a high national level of protection which can be retained until such time as we get acceptable international regulations adopted. But we need to get a move on before a major accident occurs. We have been lucky. But for how long will our luck last, and for how long can we go on saying that we are getting by unscathed? One of these days, an accident will happen with disastrous consequences, and we shall be left with a bad taste in our mouths for not having got things organised. So let us make sure now that we get this matter sorted out properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Konrad (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I wish to speak in favour of the report by Mr Hatzidakis, simply because we do need regulations on the transportation of dangerous goods in Europe. I would, however, add at the same time that this report also describes the tense relationship of road and rail. We have, in the agreements which we are to conclude here, repeatedly drawn attention, from many different points of view, to the fact that rail transport must be intensified. This is as is should be, because we do need these transport operators, particularly in the case of dangerous goods. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must approach this subject honestly and ask ourselves whether we have the necessary capacity in this sector. I have my doubts in this regard. I think all of us here, getting up on our soap-boxes, have repeatedly discussed the capacity of the railway system, a capacity which just does not exist in reality, either because too few rail networks are available or because there is much too much passenger traffic on these rail networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we need a touch more honesty in this discussion. I myself come from a region in Germany, the Ruhr, in which there is a very dense railway network, but despite that we can observe in the same region that the capacity available is simply far from adequate, even if it was required.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to introduce a second aspect in connection with this, a matter which I believe it is very important to take note of. Whenever the European Parliament discusses this theme or similar ones, it is clear to me that this is a field which we must deal with on the European scale, for example, on the subject of railways, or on the subject of the transportation of dangerous goods. It is accepted that we should establish a common European transport policy. It is accepted that we should establish a common European environmental policy, and these are precisely the areas where this Parliament and European policy are credible, in my opinion. So what use are national regulations, for dangerous goods on the road, for instance, if we need Europe-wide regulations? This is precisely the point described in this report. We do not need to justify to the citizens of Europe the fact that we need a common European environmental policy or a European safety policy in this field relating to dangerous goods. It has been accepted and is understood. It is applicable, besides, to other areas of transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just mention, in connection with this, that there is no longer anyone in Europe who understands why we still regulate aviation safety in Europe on a national and not a European basis. I am therefore grateful to President Prodi for adding this as a point and clearly emphasising it in the Commission’s intergovernmental programme. We must put an end to petty national jealousies and say that, with five phases, we could guarantee safety in aviation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area we need European solutions, not national solutions, and here the national state is yielding none of its sovereignty. Instead, all one is trying to understand here is what is necessary in order to provide safety. The sovereignty of national states was lost long ago in the fields of the environment, aviation, or safety. This is an area where Europe must make a positive contribution. That is why this report may be seen in isolation as dealing with a specific subject, but when it is examined in the European context, it becomes clear that this report is outlining more than the specific subject of dangerous goods on the rail network. It exemplifies the fact that in this House we do see connections, and this is something I wished to stress clearly once more. Let us approve this report, and on all matters let us keep in mind the big picture, seeing this as a document which contributes towards a Europe which is responsive to its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mr Hatzidakis, rapporteur and President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for the excellent report which he has carried out concerning the proposed amendment of the framework Directive on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the framework directive entered into force in January 1997 and the current Commission proposal attempts to resolve the problems of application of the transitional provisions concerning containers for the transport of gases and tanks. In fact, as has been correctly pointed out by Mr Hatzidakis, this directive lays down certain transitional provisions, valid until 1 January of the current year, in order to allow for the termination of certain work by the European Committee for Standardisation. To this end, I would like to express my agreement with Mr Hatzidakis and with certain other speakers and to express my regret that the European Committee for Standardisation has still not reached an agreement which would allow Member States to legislate in accordance with what will be the final regulation, and not to find themselves in a position, if today and in the weeks to come we are not capable of amending the current directive, where they have to legislate to amend the legislation once again within a short space of time, with all the problems which that would entail.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking in the short term about the application of paragraph 4 of Article 6 which refers to containers for the transport of class 2 gas, as well as the corresponding tanks. The time limit for this provision causes problems and therefore we will have to see how this situation can be resolved. We are simply trying to resolve a question which, if the Committee had done its work on time and correctly, we would not be facing now.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the second objective of the present proposal is the amendment of certain provisions concerning derogations, with the aim of making them more precise, as well as the amendment of the procedure for their approval. Given the good reception in this regard, which amounts to an acceptance without amendments on the part of this Parliament, it only remains for me to thank you for your cooperation, study and work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to make some comments about what has been said in the debate. Firstly, it is clear that a directive is necessary because we are amending a previous directive. In this case, the instrument necessary to amend a directive is another directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Passing on to other matters, I would like to reply to Mr Pohjamo that Directive 96/35 on safety advisers, which will enter into force on 1 January 2000, will contribute to the application of the legislation on the transport of dangerous goods, and make it more transparent and more in line with our intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like lastly to comment briefly on what Mr Konrad said with regard to the capacity of rail transport and the promotion of railways by the Commission and the Member States. It is true, as he has said, that in certain areas of the network we have a situation of overload, with infrastructures which are already very well used, particularly for the transport of persons, which is the form of use which is currently the priority of all the Member States in terms of their railway policy. In recent years, when the Member States have supported the railway it has mainly been with regard to the transport of persons. These magnificent and successful efforts mean that today we have high speed trains which connect, for example, Brussels and Paris in little more than an hour.</p>
<p class="contents">But in fact we still have the problem of the transport of goods by rail. And I believe that in this area we still have work to do. The forecast regarding the increase in the transport of goods in the coming years – which is good or bad depending on your point of view – is very significant. This increase will be the result of increased development and growth in our countries and, in a way, if it did not happen, it would be a bad indication with regard to the performance of our economy and therefore of our society as well.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we must improve the infrastructures. And above all the interoperability of our trains. As Mr Konrad has explained very effectively, when you arrive at a border in a goods train, it probably takes six or seven hours to cross the border. But this problem also has its equivalent in the field of air transport. If, for example, you travel by car and cross the border between Germany and France, nobody asks you to identify yourself nor to say whether you are crossing the country. However, if you travel by plane, you have to ask permission to cross from one side to the other and sometimes it is even granted when you are already in a third country because you have already crossed in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wish to repeat my thanks and say that I hope that we will soon conclude the handling of this directive, which will allow the Committee for Standardisation to carry out its work correctly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
