<p class="contents">The differing natures of the four physical agents – noise, vibration, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields – led to a new approach on the part of the Council in 1999, which advocated specific directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the directives on vibration and noise, today we are examining the Directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive falls under the heading of measures to improve the working environment because, according to Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the heading ‘Fair and just working conditions’, every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, we must make it clear that the new Directive is extremely careful about its potential socio-economic impact, since it does not impose new obligations which were not already contained in the framework directive; it simply sets out their specific details.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive only deals with short- and medium-term adverse effects and not long-term adverse effects because of the lack of solid scientific data. It does not deal with risks involving contact with live conductors. Protection in this case is contained in the framework directive. The proposal’s scope does not provide for exceptions, because that would represent discrimination, within the meaning of Article 13 of the EC Treaty and Article 20 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, this is a health and safety directive, which is intended to eliminate risks at origin, although a specific directive – 93/42/EEC, for example – obliges the manufacturer to comply with essential requirements. Use may be incorrect and therefore the sources of risk may be many and varied.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to understand the preventive content, we must take account of two concepts. Firstly, the exposure limit value above which no one is permitted to work. Secondly, the action value which leads to an action in accordance with the terms laid down in the proposal. This Parliament’s contributions mainly focus on the obligations for employers in terms of evaluating and measuring the levels of the electromagnetic fields workers are exposed to, on the consultation and participation of those workers and on training and information. Another of Parliament’s contributions is to set out detailed requirements for containing and monitoring this power – Article 8 – with the aim of preventing and diagnosing as swiftly as possible any adverse effect on health due to exposure to electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p class="contents">When exposure exceeding the limit values is detected, a medical examination is required and, in the event that any damage to health as a result of exposure is detected, the employer will be obliged to carry out a reassessment of the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are laid down, in accordance with national legislation – of course – in the event of infringement.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament votes in favour of this report and the Council accepts Parliament’s amendments, the Directive will be the result of a form of social dialogue, of political dialogue, in this case, through the joint efforts of the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group who, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, have understood that, by means of this Directive, we could improve working conditions for European workers. We accepted the initial proposal by Mr Crowley of the UEN Group. In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to thank him and all my fellow Members for their contributions and, in particular, the coordinator for the Socialist Group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Stephen Hughes. Without this agreement, the Directive would not be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">If we achieve the necessary votes tomorrow, we will have a Directive which is the result of dialogue between the majority political groups in this House aimed at improving the living conditions of workers and protecting their dignity as human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It really is an immense honour and joy to be here in the European Parliament this evening. I am sorry that I did not have the opportunity to meet the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but I shall meet them tomorrow, at the meeting we are to hold in the afternoon. I am especially glad that I shall have the opportunity in the future to work closely with the European Parliament and the relevant committees.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Pérez Álvarez was perfect and I must also thank him on behalf of the Commission because, on such a difficult technical issue as that in the proposal on physical agents, especially electromagnetic fields, he spoke so well and his report was truly exceptional. The difficulty with this issue is exacerbated by the fact that, although the amended proposal was submitted to the Council back in 1994, the first part of the proposal – on vibration – was only approved in 2002 and the second part – on noise – was only approved in 2003. Now we have the third part on electromagnetic fields at the level of second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to attach the greatest importance to all measures which are designed to protect the health and safety of workers and which constitute an important factor in relation to the quality of life. The social agenda emphasised this issue, which was confirmed in the Commission communication on a new strategy for health and safety in the workplace. I am of the opinion that legislation on electromagnetic fields will be a fundamental step towards achieving better protection for the health and safety of workers exposed to risks from physical agents. The most recent scientific information available shows that overexposure to electromagnetic fields may have serious consequences on the health of workers and therefore merits special attention. The directive makes provision for precautions to protect the health and safety of workers, especially from induced electric currents in the body, shocks and burns and absorption of thermal energy produced by electromagnetic fields. It should be noted that it was not yet possible to examine the carcinogenic effect of electromagnetic fields, due to a lack of adequate scientific data or indication of a link of cause and effect between electromagnetic fields and cancer. For similar reasons, the directive does not set definitive values for exposure to static magnetic fields. Nonetheless, it should be noted that, within the framework of the Commission report on the practical application, the Commission will pay particular attention to these issues and will closely monitor developments in scientific data in these two sectors. If necessary, it will submit the necessary proposals at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the Members of Parliament on the quality of their amendments expressing Parliament’s concern and interest as regards the risks and results of exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields. It should be noted that the Commission, throughout the highly technical and very difficult legislative procedure, made intensive and, on occasion, persistent efforts to preserve a high level of protection in the text, while at the same time ensuring that a final compromise solution could be reached. It should be noted that, in order to achieve an overall compromise, the Commission accepted the Council common position, even though it had reservations about the watering down of the provisions on health surveillance. I am particularly pleased to see that one of your amendments, Amendment No 3, corrects this shortcoming in the common position and restores the preventive nature of health surveillance. As far as your amendments are concerned, the Commission can accept them as they stand, in that they improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, Amendment No 1 clarifies the procedure for assessing levels of exposure in accordance with the provisions of framework directive 89/391. Amendment No 2 improves the quality of the text, in that the content of the information which must be provided to workers is further supplemented. Amendment No 3 strengthens health surveillance in complete harmony with the Commission’s reservations on the common position. Amendment No 4 introduces a standardised provision governing sanctions, while Amendment No 5 stipulates the frequency of the Commission report, in keeping with the other health and safety directives.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need for me to tell you that this report will evaluate scientific developments concerning the long-term effects of exposure to electromagnetic waves and the effects of static electromagnetic fields. At the same time, any further initiatives will be examined in the light of new scientific knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also remind you that the gradual approach taken to the examination of the Commission proposal, starting with vibration, followed by noise and now electromagnetic fields, does not obviate the need for further work to be undertaken on the remaining physical agent included in the Commission’s initial proposal, by which I mean optical radiation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall then address the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Álvarez. I see that Mr Hughes is not here today. That is because it is sometimes difficult to make one’s way to Strasbourg because of the lack of air connections. Mr Hughes has got caught up on the way here. On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and of Mr Hughes, I wish to thank Mr Pérez Álvarez for his very constructive cooperation. The fact that we have obtained this result has a lot to do with the sound cooperation between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists. Mr Pérez Álvarez and Mr Hughes have been the leading figures in this cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have set out in pursuit of two objectives. The first is to produce a sound directive in this area that guarantees employees’ health and security. The second objective has been to reach an agreement before the end of the term of office so that we do not keep putting off the issue. It has already been said that this directive is part of the health and safety and physical agents package. We have previously dealt successfully with vibrations and noise and are now dealing with electromagnetic fields and workers’ exposure to these.</p>
<p class="contents">This affects many people in the labour market. Let me take a few examples in the form of people within health-care, large-scale catering and the metal industry. It is an important directive on which we now have to adopt a position. A debate has taken place on the long-term effects and on the difficulties of finding scientific observations enabling the long-term effects to be evaluated. I think that, through the amendments we have produced in the committee and for which we hope to obtain a hearing, we are highlighting some important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, consultation and cooperation with employees is being debated. Another important subject is, of course, prevention: that is to say, when an employee suffers overexposure, he should have an automatic right to health checks. If, in the course of these health checks, it emerges that the employee has suffered overexposure and been harmed, a further risk evaluation should be carried out. I consider this perhaps to be the most important proposal among the amendments now being tabled by our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that there should be serious consequences for those employers who do not comply with these recommendations. I must also mention the last amendment to the effect that there is a deadline before which the Commission must respond. If new findings come to light, the initiative must be taken and Parliament consulted again.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say a big thank you. This has been an example of constructive cooperation, and I hope the outcome will be successful. I am convinced it will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report and the mechanism by which we are getting it through Parliament is the best example of cooperation that there is between the institutions. Because of the time-frame within which we are now working during the Irish presidency, in particular with regard to the upcoming elections in June, it was necessary to find a compromise and a consensus, which may not be suitable for everybody, and may not cover all the individual points that each Member wanted to see covered, but does allow for legislation to be put on the books to ensure that workers are protected in these new risks to which they are exposed.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the advancing use of technology, in particular the dangers that may emanate from that technology, it is essential that this Parliament, and indeed the European Union as a whole, is seen to be able to respond quickly to those new innovations, as well as those new risks.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have before us is a compromise package. In recent weeks the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs tabled five amendments which have been taken on board by Coreper and by the Council as a whole under the guidance of the Irish presidency. This will allow us to bring forward this legislation into the domain of workers' rights, following on from a very proud and strong tradition of this House in ensuring the protection of workers under health and safety legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to welcome Commissioner Dimas to his new position. I know it is very difficult for someone coming into office in such a short space of time. I wish him well in his office and promise my cooperation and that of my Group in his work in the coming months. The health and safety of workers must be to the forefront of all our legislation. Of course it is important that we try to put in place rules and regulations with regard to competition and competitiveness to ensure that workers can have jobs, but as well as having jobs, they must be good jobs with real rewards and real protection. It is only when we meet all these criteria that we can truly say that we have worked properly on behalf of all the citizens of the European Union. I commend this report to the House. I would ask all Members to endorse it and to support it so that we can move forward in this era of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course a great pleasure after so many years to be able to put the finishing touches to this directive. There is no doubt about that. The directive has been in preparation for an incredibly long time, and I am also delighted to commend it to the House tomorrow. It is also good that, unlike the other directives on physical agents, it is not full of transitional periods, possible dispensations and a host of exemptions. This is something I think we can learn from when preparing the future directives in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I must say how disappointed I am that the directive does not in any way mention the long-term effects of electromagnetic fields. I am aware that there are problems in showing the connection between exposure and the development of cancer. I think, however, that our legislation has to be influenced by the fact that we at present see a number of examples of people who worked with radar in the seventies and eighties and who now appear to be following a pattern of developing cancer. I find it disappointing that this is not mentioned at all in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, at some time or other, we must take account of the fact that there is also a precautionary principle in this area. If we begin to see a pattern in those cases whereby, after 20 or 30 years, people develop cancer, we should do something about the fact. I should therefore like to ask you directly, Commissioner, whether I heard you correctly and whether you do in fact interpret Article 11 of the directive as saying that the Commission undertakes to present a new proposal as soon as there is new knowledge of the long-term effects of electromagnetic fields. I should be very glad if the Commission could confirm this. I think it is very important for the next Parliament to have a practical basis on which to proceed further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
