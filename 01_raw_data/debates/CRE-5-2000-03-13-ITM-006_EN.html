A good Commissioner should listen! Can that be deducted from the time?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I actually wanted to address a minor comment to you, which applies both to this report and to the preceding one. There comes a time when you have to come to a decision, because post-Amsterdam the conciliation procedure is the great good. Parliament is obviously always pleased when the Commission fights at Parliament's side as its partner and does not necessarily rush obediently to the Council's cause. I do not believe that this is necessary here.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted actually to relate this comment to the report before us. The President has read out a very laborious title. Mr President, with your permission I will simply talk about lorry inspections; that would be understood both in Regensburg and in Lübeck, and perhaps the Commission might also perhaps manage to use somewhat shorter titles.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we simply cannot do enough for road traffic safety. There is a consensus on that. This directive on lorry inspections should quite simply make a contribution to this. We are seeing a slight fall in the number of those killed and injured on the roads. Nevertheless – and regrettably – where the accidents involve lorries the numbers of those both killed and injured are rising. The causes are often precisely technical defects. We must not sit back and accept this. After all, a lorry does around 150 000 kilometres a year. This is an inconceivably high number compared with a private car. When it is under a strain of this kind, maximum technical roadworthiness is required in the interests of road safety, environmental protection and not least equitable competition. Because a fleet of lorries in a poor state of technical repair should certainly not have a competitive advantage, and conversely no haulier should be punished if he keeps his lorries in optimal technical condition.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Europeans are obviously not so well behaved that they can manage without checks. This directive tries to cater for this problem by introducing a graduated inspection procedure until the vehicle is taken out of service. There has been a high measure of agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, apart from on one problem and that is penalties. In its common position, the Council makes no mention of any arrangements. This is obviously nonsense because if I am going to carry out inspections there have to be penalties which I can use as a threat in borderline cases. Then the Council said – and these might not be its exact words – that the penalties would be directed at the Member States. No, penalties should be directed at hauliers, lorry-owners and drivers. That is why – as discussed in the committee – I have now tabled an amendment to Amendment No 2 which contains no reference to the concept of ‘harmonisation’. I have done this in the knowledge that the Council is going some way to accommodate us and that we in turn can also then accommodate the Council, because this directive, in my view, is a logical step forwards. Nevertheless – and the Council has to be aware of this – it is of course sensible that the Member States should have to reach an agreement, sooner or later, amongst themselves in the Council about these controls and the penalties threatened, because it would be ridiculous if for example offences carried almost a prison sentence in Finland and only a small fine in a southern country, or vice versa. That would not make any sense. Neither is it very European. That is why, on the procedure, I should like to say once more that Amendment No 3 replaces Amendment No 2 which was adopted by the committee. It ought therefore to be put to the vote first tomorrow. If the Bureau, which will be chairing the vote tomorrow, could be informed of this I would be very grateful. Then we would not have any procedural problems with this.</p>
<p class="contents">So, put Amendment No 3 to the vote first. It would then replace Amendment No 2. This is what was discussed in the committee, and then we could have this system very quickly and not work towards a costly conciliation procedure for the sake of a solution which is in principle sensible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me simply to offer the Vice-President a helping hand so that she might support Amendment No 3 – which replaces No 2 – after all. In this room there are sometimes Members who say that of course it is sensible to standardise the vehicle inspections in terms of how rigorous and how comprehensive they are. But when it comes to penalties and the word ‘harmonisation’ a good many people in this room give a start – on the left and on the right of this House, both those higher up and those lower down. That is why I think that this Amendment No 3 which Mr Piecyk has drafted as rapporteur is excellent. He has completely avoided the word ‘harmonisation’. But he has said what this is all about. He has said that it cannot be right, if a commercial vehicle, a bus carrying passengers, is used when it does not comply with safety regulations – constituting danger to life and limb – for this to be regarded as a minor offence in one country while it meets with severe punishment in another. Given the danger to the passengers and also other drivers this would, however, be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this is not about the question of whether we are in favour of subsidiarity or centralism. It is about the fact that it is unacceptable for us to have the common aim of road safety, but for some governments to say: well, from the point of view of penalties we regard road safety offences as being on a par with disobeying a sign to keep off the grass, while others give it the correct weighting. The first principle, Madam Vice-President, is for us all to attach the same degree of importance to the need to improve road safety. The second argument is that there must be no distortions of competition in the Community. There are definitely examples of lorries from another Member State being subjected to particularly stringent controls, having tough penalties imposed, being detained, and so on in one country while in another country the authorities could not care less. This lies at the heart of the difference between Parliament's views and the common position. We certainly believe that where the penalties – which will remain within national competence – are concerned, the Member States ought to try to reach an agreement by asking themselves the following questions: what degree of importance do I attach to danger caused by road traffic? And how am I to ensure that there is fair competition within the Community in an internal market?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Madam Vice-President, after a certain party's election victory in a large federal state you would make my evening complete if you were to say: we can accept the rapporteur's Amendment No 3! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all very aware that one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, quite rightly, is to tackle the scandalous position regarding road safety in the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I know they are familiar figures, but 43 000 citizens are killed each and every year. That is the equivalent to a medium-sized town being wiped off the face of the earth every year. We therefore welcome this initiative as a means of at least trying to ensure the heavy goods vehicles are as safe as is possible and comply with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lorry traffic on EU roads is growing both in numbers and in size and we think there are three reasons why this proposal is so important. Firstly, the safety argument that we have already heard about. Secondly, the fair competition argument that my colleague Mr Jarzembowski has already referred to – the need to create a level playing field throughout the Community. Thirdly, there are also the environmental benefits – the possibility of ensuring quieter and less polluting vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a need for EU-wide random checks, and the UK – my own Member State – has already been applying such a system with very positive results. This proposal will inevitably be bad news for cowboy operators, but as well as being bad news for them, it is going to be good news for all other road users, particularly the vast majority of lorry drivers, owners and operators who are conscientious about the quality, safety and environmental standards of their vehicles. I welcome this initiative and I hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue, in the final analysis. Drivers of commercial vehicles run up thousands of kilometres every year, and the roadworthiness of the vehicles cannot be monitored adequately by means of mere annual inspections. Roadside spot checks are also necessary because heavy goods vehicles from non-member countries often enter the area of the Union in bad condition, presenting a serious risk to safety. The newly reviewed directive will do a lot to improve road safety if its provisions are complied with properly and penalties can be imposed for breaches, penalties that are effective, along the right lines and which will serve as a warning. The directive will be more efficacious if the Member States can negotiate a harmonised system of penalties. This should not, however, slow down the prompt implementation of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Justification for the prompt reform of the directive is provided by something that happened recently in Finland. The police and the vehicle inspection authorities were conducting a spot check of sixty-two heavy goods vehicles in eastern Finland recently. The drivers of thirty-three of them received fines, and sixteen received a warning. Three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey. Only thirteen were in fully acceptable condition. A considerable number of the vehicles in bad condition were from non-member countries. The worst case was a Polish truck with no brakes in the drawing vehicle, a poorly secured load, and a trailer whose brakes were badly leaking. Everyone can imagine what sort of safety hazard such a lorry would be on roads covered in snow and ice. Our group supports Amendment No 3 and hopes the new version of the directive will come into force promptly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After the directive was discussed in the Commission, I recently asked the Commissioner about non-EU drivers driving within the EU and making use of the way people, drivers, in particular, are inspected during the technical inspections of cars. What is happening in effect is the following: drivers who do not have an employment permit in an EU Member State and who do not have a work contract in the third country benefit from the situation in that they drive a car which is registered in a particular country and which subsequently passes all inspections without a hitch, but do so outside the country where they are registered and where they carry out their activities. It is precisely in those countries that employment permits and work contracts are not checked up on. </p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I would like to argue against directly including this option in the directive, but I would at any rate recommend further exploration of this option as a secondary matter in order to find a solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the ever increasing volume of traffic on Europe's roads I am at pains to emphasise the need for vehicles to meet the highest possible technical roadworthiness standards, but also the need to take environmental aspects into account. Although – and I should like to say this most emphatically – it is also necessary, if the directive is not only to pay lip service to these ideals, for it to be applied by the Member States and invested with appropriate penalties. The best directive will be ineffective in everyday life if it does not provide any penalties for non-compliance or violations.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the amendments providing for guilty parties to be punished, because the operation of motor vehicles, which in principle presents a risk and entails a potential danger to people, must be supervised properly and with the necessary care and expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case we must prevent this from being dealt with thoughtlessly, precisely because this is about a directive which provides for rules not only for heavy goods vehicles but also for commercial vehicles carrying people. Time and again we are all severely shaken when there are major accidents which are due purely to technical defects. Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe's roads. My particular thanks go to all those who work with such dedication in this field in the committee, in the Commission and in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The motion proposes the introduction of spot checks, as vehicles have to be deemed roadworthy between tests too. These spot tests may be carried out at the roadside, at ports and harbours or where trucks are parked. This is, then, a matter of improving road safety in the EU, which is vital. The damage caused by lorries in traffic accidents is, more often than not, considerable and the state of vehicles is very patchy in different parts of Europe, so pan-European legislation and strict compliance with it will be of benefit to each and every person on the road. A major cause of concern in the European Union area is the poor state of the trucks coming from Eastern Europe. They need to be dealt with strictly. Being from East Karelia, I know that even if they had one light and the wheel brakes on one side working, it would be something.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s common position will improve road safety considerably, and the directive should enter into force as soon as possible. In establishing penal systems, however, it is important to realise that penalties must on no account be targeted at the Member State, but the driver or company involved. Enlightenment is a good thing, but, unfortunately, only proper penalties have an effect on hypocrites. Road safety is a serious matter. I recall a tragic accident in Helsinki a few weeks ago in which a wheel that had come off a lorry killed a small child. We can never assume too much responsibility when it comes to human life.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certain that the rapporteur is entirely correct in saying that the title is very long. The simplest thing is to talk about the inspection of lorries, which is what we are really discussing, and perhaps we should all think about not only putting the technical title in some of our regulations, but also, in brackets, the colloquial title or one that is more readily comprehensible to our citizens, a matter which I shall transmit to the services and which we shall consider with a view to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the subject of the proposal, it clearly concerns the roadside inspection of commercial vehicles, both passenger and goods vehicles, with the aim of increasing safety and protecting the environment with regard to road transport within the Community. It is undoubtedly intended to create a structure for the quality of maintenance of commercial vehicles in circulation in the Community, and would discourage operators and managers who try to achieve a competitive advantage by using vehicles in an inadequate state of repair.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal requires that the Member States supplement the annual technical inspection by carrying out spot checks in proportion to the fleet of commercial vehicles in circulation annually on their roads. These inspections may be carried out by the roadside, in ports and in other places where vehicles park, or, as is more frequent in the case of public service vehicles, on the operator's premises.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, several States already apply this type of inspection, the so-called ‘roadside inspections’, in the manner laid down in the directive, that is, in a somewhat unexpected manner. This may in fact be the best way to effectively monitor the state of the vehicles in circulation on our roads.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that the Commission is aware that Parliament is concerned that this proposal might lead to discrimination against certain transport contractors, or lorries from certain countries or even certain makes of vehicle, and that the intention of the principal recommendation of the rapporteur is for the fines imposed on operators by the Member States to be harmonised as a condition of application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We share this concern, but we consider that Amendment No 2 is too drastic and, in this respect, we would support Amendment No 3 which encompasses the spirit we are all aiming for, and which, at the same time, offers the necessary flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We also accept Amendment No 1, and I would like to refer to what Mr Bouwman said. In fact, we are tremendously concerned by the fact that vehicles are being driven in the Union by drivers from third countries, and in particular from candidate countries, who do not have work contracts that conform to Community standards, or the standards of any Community country, but simply obey the standards of these third countries, which are often candidates for accession, or sometimes do not even conform to these standards as the corresponding inspections are not carried out by the said third countries. I have therefore written to all the Ministers for Transport of the fifteen countries of the Union to instigate a discussion on the subject, and also to ask for a report on what the situation is in their countries regarding this type of case, and what positive suggestions they can submit so that we can find a solution to this problem, which concerns us greatly, and which could have negative consequences for road safety, which has to be our main concern, and for fair competition, which is also important to us at the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I hope that we can deal with these matters at the next Transport Council at the end of this month, as well as, as Mr Watts has said, all aspects of road safety in general since the Portuguese Presidency proposes this as one of the key matters of its Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis that great progress has been made in the past few years, I believe that a great deal still remains to be done, as the death of 42 000 – 43 000 European citizens on the roads is too high a figure and there is still an effort to be made. But I would like to say that, with regard to the problem of drivers from third countries, I hope that before the end of the month we shall have a response, and we shall, in any case, handle this within the Council. And, in response to some questions or initiatives, I shall be able to reply here in Parliament, either during the plenary session or in committee, and, if not, I hope in any case that we shall shortly be able to make a concrete proposal that enables us, truly and effectively, to combat this type of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to reiterate my appreciation of the quality of work carried out, not only by the rapporteur, but by the committee as a whole.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
