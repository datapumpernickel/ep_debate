<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Giovanni Pittella (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two questions have often sprung to my mind during this long process that has brought us to the vote at first reading. First, what is the budget? Is it a dull accounting exercise or a key political act? Secondly, do the decisions – or rather ‘codecisions’ – that we make actually correspond to our citizens’ priorities, and is it really our job to fund these priorities or would it be fairer if they were funded out of national or regional budgets?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these two questions, which apply both to the annual budget and to the financial perspectives, come before any analysis of budget lines and spending categories. They form the crux of a debate that has to rise above arid technicalities, because it is an altogether political debate. Whether the European Union should take certain measures and not others is not something that should be decided behind closed doors, fuelling a stale, vacuous dialectic between proponents of stringent and <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> attitudes.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a central theme of the European political agenda: I have to say to the Council representatives that I am astounded that there is no place for such questions at tomorrow’s Summit of Heads of State or Government. How can the Union’s social agenda be drafted without also linking it to the decisions made in the annual and multiannual budgets? That is a mystery that I hope will be answered today in the speech by President-in-Office Blair.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial resources needed to carry out our work are a key issue. The time has come to take the bull by the horns. The issue is this: are there responsibilities that have to be met at a supranational level? Is there European added value in respect of national public spending? What are these policies and programmes and where do they fit into the European budget?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall give you some examples. First, cohesion policy: is it a necessary policy and who should make it? There is no doubt that the Union is still marked by social, economic and regional imbalances. It is therefore imperative to promote economic development by addressing structural shortcomings, stimulating sustainable growth and significantly boosting employment and competitiveness. This policy needs to be made at European level because that is the only level at which it can be effective in terms of costs, procedure rationalisation and standardisation, resource sharing, objective setting and exchange of good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">My second example is research. Does research policy need to be made at European level? In other words, looking beyond the individual Member States and private players, should there also be a direct research commitment at European level? The competitive gap that has opened up in recent years, leaving our continent lagging behind both emerging and established economies, is plain for all to see. Can we close the gap just with protective measures, or do we instead need to enhance European research efforts by creating centres of excellence, adding value to industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors especially through research infrastructure and public-private partnerships, disseminating knowledge, and networking our researchers working around the world?</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European Union trains more science and engineering PhDs than the United States, but many of them decide to emigrate or switch to different careers. There are currently some 85 000 to 90 000 European researchers working in the scientific research sector in the United States. Increasing investment at European level can surely help to improve this situation. In this respect, a look at data from around the world shows that the European Union has a long way to go to catch up with its main competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, the European Union spent 1.9% of its GDP on research, whereas Japan earmarked 3.1% and the United States 2.8%. The key programme for our actions in this area, as we all know, is the sixth framework programme, and the seventh framework programme is currently nearing completion. Can we leave these instruments without adequate funding?</p>
<p class="contents">My third example is education, training, culture and youth policies. Mr Blair is right to remind us – as he did in his passionate and well-received inaugural speech for the UK Presidency here in this House – that we have to modernise our social model and drastically cut the dreadful figure of 20 million unemployed by raising productivity, training more workers in the sciences and making human capital our top priority. His position is likely to become less effective, however, unless it is accompanied by consistent decisions on the financial means to implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made some specific choices by increasing the amounts for youth-oriented programmes. Before this budget there had perhaps never been such a large increase for the three fundamental youth programmes: Socrates, Leonardo and YOUTH. We must send out a strong message to the young people of Europe and remain consistent with the Youth Pact, which the Governments themselves launched a few months ago. We must set up new pilot schemes, such as Erasmus for young entrepreneurs and Erasmus for upper secondary school students (16- to 18-year-olds).</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, external actions. We have seen a paradoxical situation arise in recent years. On the one hand, the European Union has rightly been called upon to play a more united and incisive role in world affairs, yet on the other there has also been a demand, particularly from the Member States, to retain the power of veto on external policy as well as an utterly inadequate level of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe are thus all the more justified in lamenting the Union’s substantial lack of influence on the broader international stage. The Community budget, roughly amounting to a mere EUR 5 billion, is now expected to cover reconstruction in Iraq, reconstruction in Afghanistan, the tsunami emergency, humanitarian aid, strengthening democracy, protecting human rights in crisis regions, fighting poverty and destitution, cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and dozens and dozens of other major initiatives. On top of that, it has just been announced – and rightly so – that we need to increase our aid for the reconstruction of Pakistan in the post-earthquake emergency there. Then it has also been announced that we will make a more substantial contribution to assist the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">All that means that we are caught in an untenable position between these political statements, commitments and – I venture to say – duties, and the heading 4 appropriation, which is only EUR 5 billion. This contradictory position leads our fellow citizens to see us all – the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council – as classic cases of ineffectual leaders. Those, then, are the issues that I believe concern our budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard the strategy adopted by the Committee on Budgets as being based on the following principles: remaining consistent with previous years’ approaches; leaving all possible strategic options open to Parliament, so that a final decision can be made during conciliation in November, without nullifying the interinstitutional agreement at this juncture, but making maximum use of the flexibility instrument to stand by all our priorities; guaranteeing an adequate general level of payments; ensuring an adequate general level of Structural Fund payments; providing maximum support to achieve the Lisbon goals by increasing funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, research, the environment and above all youth policies; increasing the financial commitment under heading 4 (external actions), where the ceiling does not allow funding for the new emergencies that every year are added to the existing ones – Afghanistan, Iraq, the tsunami – at the same time as Parliament’s traditional priorities. I shall spare you the figures, which you know at least as well as I do, and move on to the political conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Representatives of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that is our position. It is a strong and reasonable position for an ambitious yet unpretentious budget. It is a position on which we are united, thanks to responsible contributions by all the political groups. I should like to thank all the group coordinators in the Committee on Budgets and all those Members who have contributed to our work and enabled us to examine the 900 or more amendments, and who thus far have ensured a very broad consensus for our platform. I am grateful to the Commissioner for the cooperation that has been established, which has grown stronger and stronger and become invaluable, to the extent that our positions have become very broadly convergent. I thank Mr Lewis, the Council representative: I thank him today for the perfect courtesy with which he has conducted his dialogue with Parliament; I should like to thank him tomorrow for the positive responses that I hope the Council will give us during conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks also go to Chairman Lewandowski and the staff and secretaries that have assisted me, particularly my peerless assistant – please excuse this personal note, but it is sincere and well-deserved – in the gruelling work of recent months; I am sure she will continue to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final message is again addressed directly to the Council. We often say that there is bound to be a terrible tug-of-war between Parliament and the Council between first and second reading. However, I ask the Council: is that really the case? Is it inevitable that blood will run in Charlemagne’s golden halls? Do we have to come armed with Article 272 hidden up our sleeve? Is it so very difficult to understand that what is at stake is not a collection of crazy corporative demands but, more simply and dramatically, the future and the fate of Europe, of our institutions, and of the relationship of trust between us and our fellow citizens – a relationship that has worn very thin but can still be mended and revived?</p>
<p class="contents">This budget is a bridge to the new programming period. It comes at a terrible time in the life and history of the Union. It cannot escape you, Mr Lewis, your representatives who are here today, or even Mr Blair, that there are challenges that no one can face alone, no matter how faithful you are to the British tradition, from Churchill onwards, whereby you are more partners than part of united Europe. These challenges, from cohesion to competitiveness to external actions, can only be faced by the Union if it has sufficient financial means to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The new global scenarios, which could not even be foreseen when the current financial perspectives were decided in 1999, place pressing demands on us to which we must respond appropriately. I think very few people are asking for less Europe, while many are demanding more Europe. My hope is that the second half of the UK Presidency will present us with two shining, decisive outcomes to get us back on our feet. Together we can deliver a good budget for 2006, and together we can deliver the new financial perspectives by the end of this year, ushering in a new period of confidence in the European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The significance of this vote will be greater than just the setting of an annual allocation of EU finances. 2006 is the last year of the existing Financial Perspective. Therefore, the 2006 budget will also serve as a point of reference in taking decisions for the next Financial Perspective, that for 2007–2013.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 2006 budget for the other EU institutions, the main priorities are EU enlargement and the effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources. The first priority is connected with the successful completion of the 2004 round of EU enlargement, by fully integrating representatives from the new EU Member States into the EU institutions, as well as preparations for the next round of EU enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join. We have an unacceptable situation where, despite more than a year having already passed since EU enlargement, many permanent staff posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant. One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff. In order to ensure that the next round of EU enlargement is successful, it is proposed that support should be given to all the permanent staff posts requested by the other institutions in connection with enlargement, and also other additional expenditure connected with EU enlargement. The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources. This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; giving support to requests for new budget requests and permanent staff posts only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; giving support to new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources. Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers – the European Parliament and the Council – endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayers’ money. The Council is proposing to reduce the administrative expenditure of the other institutions by 15 million euro as compared with the institutions’ original requests. It must be said, however, that in many cases this reduction has been implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutions’ work. Following a careful review of the requests in the budget for the other institutions it is proposed to restore part of the reductions made by the European Council to the budget – a total amount of 7.5 million euro. With regard to the European Parliament budget, firstly I should like to emphasise the issue of the ceiling on joint expenditure. After a wide-ranging discussion within the Committee on Budgets, taking into account the experience of last year with inflated budget votes and the resulting failure to achieve Parliament’s budgeted expenditure, it is proposed to reduce Parliament’s budgeted expenditure by 20 million euro as compared with the administration’s requests. I believe that the European Parliament budget ought to be set on the basis of needs that have been established following careful evaluation. Achieving a ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure is not an end in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the issue of the sum of over 200 million euro per year which is spent additionally in order to provide the European Parliament with a seat in Strasbourg is still a topical one. The main problem is the maintenance of two European Parliament buildings in parallel, in Brussels and Strasbourg. It must be acknowledged that this matter falls within the jurisdiction of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Considerable attention has been paid in the European Parliament’s budget for 2006 to information and communication policy, to ensure that information is accessible and that the work of the European Parliament is better explained to EU citizens. The European Parliament’s role as the representative of the EU Member States should be especially stressed in this connection. Various measures have already been taken. I can mention, for instance, the launch of the new European Parliament home page, where much more emphasis has been placed on current information about the work of the European Parliament in all the official EU languages. It is proposed that in 2006 the European Parliament’s visitors’ programme should be improved, and that a special reserve should be established for information and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to return to the issue I emphasised at the beginning of my speech. In view of the fact that 2006 is the final year of the current Financial Perspective, it is important for the total amount of commitment and payment appropriations for the 2006 budget to correspond with the commitments which the European Union has undertaken, including those connected with EU enlargement. I fully agree with what Mr Pittella said, that in 2006 it is necessary to provide an adequate amount of payment appropriations, including for the Structural Funds. The attitude adopted by the European Council in connection with the EU budget for 2005, where it artificially blocked the amount of payment appropriations, was unacceptable. Now the unjustified nature of the European Council’s stance has become obvious. The European Commission is preparing amendments to the 2005 budget, providing a larger sum of payment appropriations for the Structural Funds. If the European Council tries once more to block the amount of payment appropriations for the 2006 budget, that will prove the Council’s unwillingness to fully finance those commitments which the EU has undertaken within the framework of the existing Financial Perspective. It must be said that this indulging in empty promises without backing them up with deeds increases the alienation and scepticism that citizens feel towards the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would also like particularly to draw the attention of Commissioner Grybauskaitė to the poor quality of the Latvian translation of the budget prepared by the European Commission. For example, budget lines 02030202 and 02030203, which deal with medicines for treating rare diseases. The Commission’s Latvian translation talks about resources for treating orphans and medicines for orphans. Therefore, the Commissioner should not be surprised: she is going to receive requests from Latvia’s orphans to fund their medicines, since that is what it actually says in the translation prepared by the European Commission. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to avoid translation-related problems, I will continue in English. </p>
<p class="contents">To avoid interpreting problems, I would like to give my more technical presentation in English. Mr Pitella has set us a fine example with his presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall go through the various headings. On agricultural expenditure, under heading 1a, the Commission will, in a week’s time, present its new estimates in accordance with the new market tendencies which, according to our information, will mean a reduction in the estimates that the Commission proposed for agricultural expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second heading – structural actions – the PDB proposed by the Commission was presented and established on the basis of observed trends and our revised estimates, which do not exactly correspond with those of the Member States. The Commission will submit an amending letter at the beginning of November, bearing in mind that we will be receiving the final data from the Member States at the end of this month, so we will be coming to you in the first weeks of November with the final level, which will have to be determined in trialogue in November.</p>
<p class="contents">On internal policies, Parliament has tabled a lot of amendments, mainly on co-decided programmes. So, as usual, the Commission confirms that it will support any proposals in the co-decided envelope, if this is agreed between two budgetary authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">External action is the most difficult heading for all of us, especially because it entails pressure as regards the use of the Flexibility Instrument. Next year we will need expenditure at least for the tsunami and for sugar reform, and it is becoming clear that two further items of expenditure will be needed: support for Gaza and the earthquake in Pakistan. This defines and distinguishes clearly how we should reflect or understand the Flexibility Instrument’s usage in future, and I would like to re-confirm what I said recently in COBU: the Commission and its Legal Service understand that, for 2006, up to EUR 493 million are available under the Flexibility Instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">On administrative expenditure and posts, I welcome the reinstatement of all the PDB requests we presented. I also welcome the reaction from Council and Parliament to our message sent in September about recruitment, and I would like to correct a point in Mr Dombrovskis’ presentation. All 1480 posts for new Member States have been filled as at present. There are no vacant posts left. We are doing our best.</p>
<p class="contents">So, if EUR 16 million is to be reserved in the way proposed today, subject to very demanding conditions, which cannot be met promptly next year, we will be confronted with recruitment problems in respect of about half of the new posts proposed, some 200 to 300 posts. Nonetheless, the Commission will take the opportunity to comment on the amendments as a whole, especially those to be tabled – and which are indeed of great importance to Parliament – in our letter on implementability. I will send this to you in advance of the second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to wish the rapporteur and Parliament a very constructive debate and successful vote tomorrow. The Commission will be on your side, helping to reach a deal for 2006 in November or, at the latest, in December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Pittella has very kindly accepted about 80% of the Committee on Development’s amendments to the budget. We all know that this budget is very stretched. Mr Pittella has himself explained how external actions have been very difficult: Afghanistan, Iraq, the tsunami, Gaza, and the earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">The earthquake represents a challenge. Three million people are stranded on mountainsides freezing to death. They have no tents, food or water. Logistically it is impossible to supply them with food, water and heat, etc. We do not know how much it is going to cost this year. The response to the tsunami was magnificent – I was caught up in the middle of it. USD 5.3 billion was raised globally, of which the European Union committed EUR 160 million and then further sums under the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am conscious that the UK Presidency is very concerned about the earthquake and Pakistan. To feed and look after three million people over the winter will be difficult. Do we adopt a family and ask the Pakistani people in Karachi, Lahore or Rawalpindi to look after these people over the six-month period and help them with coupons, ration cards and provide them with food so that we do not allow them to starve and die on mountain tops? I do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very grateful that much of what the Committee on Development has asked for has been given. I only regret that the handwashing programme – which we talked about in my committee – was not accepted by the budget rapporteur. I would like that to be noted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, Hong Kong in December can be more important for development than the Gleneagles summit in the summer was. However, there is more to trade than simple liberalisation: we have to give developing countries assistance in getting their goods to the market and we have to give them assistance in terms of meeting our technical and health standards.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on International Trade is proposing a new budget line called 'aid for trade'. It is not that we do not already have trade assistance in our budget, but at the moment it is spread over two hundred different budget lines. The Trade Committee would like this to be unified into one single budget line. We would like a clear budget line so that aid for trade is more easily mobilised, more visible and more accessible to the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets for coming to a couple of meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control and listening to the concerns and queries of the Committee. It is a very healthy process for us all to be involved in.</p>
<p class="contents">The process by which the Budgetary Control Committee operates is as follows: we go through our discharge reports and look at conclusions and points that we have raised with which the House has concurred and which the Commission has not completely implemented, and then draw up amendments to try to ensure implementation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We also look at the OLAF budget in great detail because it is one of the areas where we have many concerns and will have many concerns in the future. This year, OLAF asked for a great deal more staff, in fact 25 new staff and an increase in its budget of 10 %, which our committee, the committee that should be the most proactive and supportive of OLAF (as I believe it probably is), was concerned that this level of new staff was not actually required. One of the amendments in the budget this year has details on that. We are seeking a satisfactory explanation, which I am not sure we have properly received.</p>
<p class="contents">We also called on the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors to amend their respective administrative decisions by 1 November of this year in such a way as to rule out the private use of official cars, and there are amendments in the budget for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and completely off track and on a personal note, there is an amendment signed by all Members across this House to allow funding of Europe-wide events to encourage the social inclusion of young people and mentally disabled people through sporting activities, which I hope the rapporteur will pick up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As for giving support to the Fiscalis Programme, which is aimed at improving the functioning of the indirect taxation systems of the internal market, we are training the officials required in each country because, as far as we are concerned, doing so will guarantee that the Union has a future and is secure and prosperous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whose opinion I was the draftsperson, welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgets has acknowledged and accepted the need to increase certain headings, and, moreover, to reinstate the amounts laid down in the preliminary draft budget with regard to the European Social Fund, the EQUAL programme, EURES, measures to fight and prevent social exclusion and the Leonardo programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, some of our suggestions fell by the wayside, some of which are very close to our hearts, and I should like to bring them to your attention. For example, Europass is an instrument for promoting the transparency of qualifications, a key factor in achieving the Lisbon goals and was presented within a package along with the Leonardo programme. We believe that the allocations to Europass should be increased, yet these aspects were not taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to the situation of the Bilbao agency, which, without any budgetary adjustment since 2004, either in terms of inflation, or in terms of meeting the needs of the enlargement, will soon be entirely unable to continue functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pitella’s efforts on behalf of the European Year of Workers’ Mobility; firstly in including it as a special annual event, given that it could not be envisaged as a pilot project; and secondly given its importance and, objectively speaking, its effectiveness in meeting the aims of making the European economy competitive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the trans-European networks are a key tool for implementing the vision of a cohesive Europe and that of regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we cannot consent to the Council’s amendments aimed at reducing expenditure on transport safety bodies. In particular, we are opposed to the cuts made to spending on the prevention of marine pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these two key issues, we should like to make it quite clear that an efficient transport system is in the interests of the citizens of the EU and of its economy, and I would ask all the political groups and Members of this House to lend us their support. I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pittella, who has contributed so much to work on this draft budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur took the needs of the Member States into account by again increasing the payments by 40%, and so there are two things I ask of them. One is that they should actually spend this money properly and in accordance with up-to-date knowledge, and the other is that, in the debate on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, they take that into account and budget accordingly for cohesion policy in future.</p>

However, nor will the European Parliament be credible if it votes for the amendment by the Committee on Budgets, on the basis of which Community subsidies are being put in reserve, by which we mean frozen, at a time when the reform of the COM in tobacco is here and has been voted on by all the governments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commission why it has not also included tobacco in the new draft budget, together with all the products which it has included in the subdivisions of category 1.</p>

<p class="contents">Generally speaking – and, at this point, I should like to thank our general rapporteur and my fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets – these amendments have been accepted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and will, I hope, be adopted tomorrow by plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning more specifically to the fight against terrorism, we are proposing a substantial increase in the operational resources given to Eurojust, at the same time as increasing by nearly 30% the appropriations allocated to the pilot project, which our Parliament wanted in order to coordinate more effectively the resources for anticipating and confronting the terrorist threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we are in favour of allocating the resources requested by the Commission in order to have a real crisis management capacity and we are proposing to extend the appropriations designed to help the victims of terrorist acts in such a way as to include legal aid.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards controlling the EU’s external borders, we are proposing a substantial increase in the resources dedicated to the new Frontex Agency and we are bringing back the payment appropriations initially included in the PDB for the Schengen Information System and for the Visa Information System. These payment appropriations had been, rather stupidly, reduced by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards data protection, we are keeping back part of the appropriations requested by the Commission for passenger rights with the aim of forcing the Commission to respect the commitments it made before Parliament on changing the system for transmitting passenger name records to the US authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore – and this will be my final point – in the motion for a resolution, we are emphasising the need to implement a mechanism aimed at protecting personal data in the third pillar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs made five proposals: we wanted more money for the Jean Monnet Chairs, more money for cultural organisations, more money for organisations advancing the idea of Europe, more money for European think-tanks and more money to debate the future of the European Union. What happened? We got nothing! The five proposals were all rejected. I am sure Mr Heaton-Harris is really happy about it, but I hate to tell him that I am very happy with his proposal, because he gave a lot of money to the PRINCE programme. We asked for EUR 9 million and we were given commitments of over EUR 4 million. That is a great thing, and, therefore, I am pleased about the changes the Committee on Budgetary Control made.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point was more of a question: what do we need the money for? We all know that the French and the Dutch rejected the Constitution in referenda, and that we need to start debating the future of the Union. That is in all our interests. The Constitution is not dead, it will continue to live on and we need to restart the debate on it. For that we need money.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is also a question: can we buy the debate with money? The answer, of course, is no. However, I think, personally and as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that it is very important to get that debate going, and the fact that the Commission has put down a plan B – sorry, a plan D – and is receiving over EUR 4 million in commitments from the Committee on Budgets is a good thing, and also good for the future of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am satisfied that we in the Budget Committee succeeded in making decisions on the most important priorities: the European Union's competitiveness and union’s improved funding, support for small and medium business, other measures for implementing the Lisbon Strategy, improvement in the security of citizens, consolidation of the recent expansion of the European Union and the growth of the European Union's role as a world partner. These priorities ought to be the focus of our efforts in 2006. If the Council approves the European Parliament's proposal on a flexible instrument, we will have sufficient funds to finance reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan and the necessary aid to carry out post-tsunami reconstruction work in several Asian countries. 2006 is an exceptional year from the budgetary point of view. It is the last year of this financial period and the Council has been unable to reach a consensus on the new financial perspective. Since preparations must be made for the next wave of European Union enlargement, I believe that the Council's behaviour is irresponsible, as enlargement is being discussed without an agreement on how it is to be funded. Therefore, the European Parliament is being forced to consider very different alternatives, including worst case scenarios. I trust that tomorrow the European Parliament will support the Budget Committee's most important proposals and we will be ready for the second conciliation meeting with the Council, which will take place in November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that we ought to change these procedures relating to a so-called budgetary debate, because it is absurd to restrict each committee to one minute’s speaking time. A new procedure really ought to be drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to you that our rapporteurs and all of the members of the Committee on Budgets have adopted a strategic approach with regard to this budget. On the one hand, the EU has needs, and it has a very large number of them: traditional policies, agricultural policy, Structural Fund policy. These needs are extensive and they certainly cost a lot of money. However, we must not forget that the EU has an ever increasing number of new needs: in terms of employment, sustainable development and everything the Lisbon Strategy entails for research, networks, information for citizens, training and security in every sense of the word, whether security against terrorism, border security or security, for example, in the current context of avian influenza.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the EU also has duties to fulfil, as regards, for example, helping the poorest people and those countries awaiting membership of the European Union, not to mention helping other countries in which the death toll is constantly rising in terms of victims of natural disasters, be they the tsunami, typhoons or the earthquake in Pakistan, of countries and regions that have been caught up in conflict – the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza – and of the sugar reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The burden on Europe’s budget is constantly increasing at exactly the same time that we are facing a shortage in revenue. We are faced with an impossible and, therefore, absurd task. This situation cannot continue. Hence our budgetary strategy, which was to allocate substantial, but by no means excessive, amounts of expenditure. However, we have not even been able to allocate all of this expenditure. We are therefore coming up against some great difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, obliged to recognise that our relationship with the Commission is improving: that is why it seems to me that, this year, we have made further progress in our method of working, precisely in order to execute the budget more effectively. This improved situation will have to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the pilot projects, we need to strengthen our action, including our preparatory actions. Our action will have to focus not only on the pilot projects we hold most dear, but on all the other pilot projects: for example, relating to SMEs, to youth assistance – particularly as part of the Erasmus programme – and to aid for the poorest countries to promote vaccinations throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that, above all, we must continue to disseminate more information around us. However, the problem is that, despite a very reasonable budget, which requires EUR 115 billion in payment appropriations – a figure corresponding to 1.04% of our GDP – we will find ourselves confronted with an imperturbable and stoic Council, which has only one thing to say: hands off my national budgets!</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Council to cooperate more effectively with us. We are aware that there are some internal difficulties, but you also need to know that Europe will not be able to move forwards without genuine new resources. In the context of our budget, we have used nothing more than what we were entitled to within the current financial perspectives, which enable us to call for a large degree of flexibility. That is what we have done because, if we truly want to have a common future, this requirement for flexibility is crucial so that we can carry out the minimum policies sought by the European Union. Finally, we want you to understand that Parliament cannot continue doing the impossible: doing more with less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I think that the draft 2006 budget, which is now before us following the vote in the Committee on Budgets, is well balanced, and I hope that, during tomorrow’s vote, we can continue to sing from the same hymn sheet regarding not only the general lines of the budget but also the details of the compromise established between a broad majority here in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say a big thank you to Mr Pittella for his major efforts in bringing about a compromise and for his readiness to listen and his considerable patience. Mr Pittella has made the youth and education programmes his main priority, and that is to his credit, I think. Precisely by investing in this area, we shall be achieving very considerable results with very few resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks should also go to Mr Dombrovskis for his work involving the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Those points in the compromise that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would particularly emphasise involve increased appropriations to the Lisbon Process, especially to research and to the programme for developing credit facilities for small enterprises in the new Member States. We should also very much like to emphasise that we have put our faith in more realistic appropriations to the area of foreign policy, in which the foreign ministers apparently think that it is the poor countries that should suffer privation so that we can fund the reconstruction following the tsunami and that it is the poor countries that, following the sugar reform, should fund the compensation paid to those countries that are deprived of their quotas. That is, of course, quite unacceptable, and that is why it is right to do what we are going to do, namely use the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the Structural Funds, adequate payment appropriations are of course required, and we can see how, in recent years, there has been better implementation of our projects. For two years, the payment appropriations in the budget have in actual fact been too low, and that is the situation we are remedying.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the budget heading, ‘Pilot projects and preparatory actions’, which is a small item, more is of course desired than there are resources for, and I am pleased that resources have been successfully earmarked for a pilot project to build safe lay-bys on European motorways, enabling us to make active efforts to prevent attacks on long-distance lorry drivers and to guarantee greater security. It is a small thing, but a very important one.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament’s budget, we wish to support the compromise whereby we set aside reserves for information policy, including Web TV, as well as for continuing to purchase buildings so that we save rent in the future. We have been reluctant to go below the 20%, but we support the compromise. It is important for us not to set aside larger reserves than necessary in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall budget we now have is larger than that offered by the Council, but not so large that we cannot defend it. Clearly, this budgetary debate is influenced by the lack of agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013. My group comes out, then, in clear support of the proposal before us. The appropriations are realistic and necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Helga Trüpel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Mr Lewis, today, again, you stand before a self-confident parliament, one that spells out how Europe’s tasks have become greater and how we consequently need more resources if we are to face these challenges. The Commission’s draft budget, with its 1.02%, is a prudent one. We regard the cuts that the Council has proposed as utterly unacceptable. We must be bold enough to fund specifically targeted tasks if we are to respond adequately to the challenges of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am much obliged to Mr Pittella, the rapporteur. Although he and I have moved closer together on essentials, there are a number of points that I would like to take up, where my group believes that there must be changes. We believe that the agricultural export subsidies in their present form are unjustifiable; for vegetables from Europe to be cheaper in countries such as Senegal than those produced locally is an intolerable state of affairs, and, by perpetuating it, we in the European Union are giving people cause to become refugees. This policy cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The tobacco subsidies must also be cut back; that would offer us the chance to free up funds that could be invested elsewhere, particularly in research policy or in education, culture and young people. Mr Pittella takes the line – and on this I agree with him – that this is where we need to spend more on enabling students to become more mobile in Europe. Real cultural provision reaches people where they are, and in making it available we should return at least to the 2004 figures.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to spend more on renewable energies if we really want an ‘away from oil’ strategy as an adequate response to the challenges of climate change. We need to do this not only for environmental reasons, but also for reasons of economic policy. Any strategy of this kind must form part of the Lisbon strategy, for it is environmental technologies that will give us an edge on the world market. This is something in which we, as Europeans, must have a particular interest, and we must be ambitious enough to make headway here.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to foreign policy, the Council keeps delivering itself of pious utterances about how we need to do more: more in Iraq, more in Afghanistan, more for the victims of the tsunami. Then it goes and cuts the expenditure on day-to-day policy. In so doing it is irresponsibly undermining the European Union’s credibility. The present budget estimates will do nothing to enable us to achieve the objectives we set ourselves in the year 2000, which involved such things as a more determined war on poverty. Like some of those Members who have already spoken, I would like again to say loud and clear to the Council that we have to make full use of this flexibility – in the shape of these EUR 493 million – if the European Union is to be able to hold its head up in the world next year and really be able to do things we have promised to various parts of the world. We therefore urge the Council not to take a rigid line on this, but to change position and join with the Commission in bringing into being a really good budget for the European Union – one that shows a commitment to its future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For years the European Parliament’s own budget has been 10% air. This being the case, the Bureau of the European Parliament has had enormous difficulties spending the 20% share of the Union’s administrative expenditure that the other institutions give Parliament without questioning what the money is to be used for. Not all the uses for the money which our Bureau quickly dreams up are acceptable, however.</p>
<p class="contents">In the drafting of the budget, a very stringent policy has been followed with regard to Section IV, whose ceiling for expenditure Parliament wishes to raise through maximum use of the flexibility instrument. The budget implementation figures proposed by the Commission for 2005 show that there is, and has been for a long time now, a lot of air in this Section; either that or the Commission is not implementing the wishes of Parliament with regard to the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The strangest aspect of the budget has to do with the budgeting of Structural Funds payments. The Council, in its own draft budget, has cut EUR 8 billion from the payment requirements put forward by the Member States. The same ministers who, on behalf of their countries, sent the Commission their country’s estimate of the amount of money needed to make payments for structural action have, in the Council, pruned back by a fifth the very requirements that they themselves put forward. Parliament has gone some way towards meeting the wishes of the Member States by taking 40% of the deficit for financing structural action into account in the budget, as advised by the Member States to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say on behalf of my group that next year’s budget will not meet the targets we have prioritised for developing the Union’s social dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The challenges facing the European Union are as follows. Firstly, economic growth is slowing. Secondly, EU businesses are becoming less competitive. Thirdly, unemployment is high and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. Fourthly, there is a lack of political will and initiative to stimulate the economies of the new Member States, with the result that the post-Communist countries remain backward and dependent in economic terms. Fifthly, the EU leaders have pushed though the decision on Turkey’s accession to the EU, despite the opposition of the majority of citizens to this decision, and despite the fact that there is a concurrent lack of political will, vision or strategy as regards Ukraine’s accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2006 budget makes no attempt to solve any of the above-mentioned problems, and in fact the opposite is the case. It is a continuation of the strategy that has been applied in previous years, which means that it will result in further economic slow-down and even more deep-rooted social and economic problems. The structure of spending is almost identical to previous years, which makes it inevitable that large sums will be spent on headings that have little effect in economic terms. At the same time, there will not be enough money to fund research and development, large infrastructure projects or aid for backward regions and countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope and structure of the 2006 budget will make it impossible to meet the challenges posed by the enlargement of the EU to include 10 new Member States. The draft budget also fails to take sufficient account of the future accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Worse yet, the 2006 budget contains a long list of superfluous expenses for a wide range of consultancy and promotional services, as well as increased spending on administration and bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we believe that the 2006 budget is flawed, and that it runs counter to the ideals of a united Europe. These include rapid economic growth, social peace and solidarity with backward regions and countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, Parliament is faced with the difficult task of adopting a draft budget that not only meets our expectations, but at the same time can be agreed on with the Council. The Commission only increased commitments and payments by 4% and 5.9% respectively in the draft 2006 budget, in the expectation that the Council would otherwise raise objections. Yet the Council still made substantial cuts, eventually reducing the draft budget from 1.02% to 1.01% of gross national income.</p>
<p class="contents">Constant cuts to EU spending by the Council pose a threat to the principles of cohesion and solidarity upon which the concept of European integration is founded. I need hardly add that this is a source of great concern to the new Member States, including Poland. Such cuts also place a question mark over the implementation, however minimal, of the principles of the Lisbon Strategy, in which the new Member States also take a great interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Polish delegation in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is celebrating a victory in the parliamentary and presidential elections held recently in Poland. We have read press reports from many EU Member States that wrongly state that the Law and Justice Party and the President-elect, Lech Kaczyński, are opposed to the EU. Some even go so far as to describe the imaginary threats that Poland and the European Union will face as a result of these elections. I should like to take this opportunity to state most emphatically that these threats are fictitious. We are in favour of the EU, even if we criticise its lack of cohesion and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I would ask is whether European integration is put more at risk by one of the many parties in Europe that voice criticism of some of the EU’s more questionable practices, or by those who are in favour of budget cuts. The position adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, and, we hope, by Parliament as a whole, may appear modest. We are quite sure, however, that it could guarantee at least a minimum level of expenditure, and one that we would find acceptable if it meant that an even smaller budget would be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is doubly true with regard to the avalanche of amendment motions proposing increases in the budget. I would like to express my appreciation for the skilful manner in which the distinguished rapporteurs Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis from Parliament’s Budget Committee have succeeded in coping with a virtual ‘pandemic’ of proposals for the 2006 EU budget. Although the Budget Committee has made every effort to consider thoroughly all of the proposed items, the resulting budget expenditure exceeds the European Council’s proposal by EUR 4 billion, amounting to an increase of nearly 4%.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this shifting and strengthening of budgetary resources is not self-serving. The increase is intended mostly for areas such as structural funds, science, research and education. These are the areas that can really become the powerhouse of the European Union, and an influx of greater funding, if put to effective use, may have a kind of ‘Viagra effect’ on the sluggish European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, getting support for this increase will call for considerable effort and a united stance during Parliament’s negotiations with the Council and the Commission. I would like to emphasise specifically the need for MEPs to exert some political influence in their parent countries in order to make their national governments adopt a positive position on the budget so that Parliament will approve it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important that we have a homogenous first reading, because we must go into the conciliation on the 24th all united and certain of the support of the political groups and the Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Our negotiating position is very hard this year due to two exceptional circumstances. Firstly, we have stretched category 4 for external actions to the maximum. Three such important priorities as Iraq, Afghanistan or the tsunami did not exist in 1999, when the current financial perspective started; category 4 has been badly financed from the outset and we have never been able to budget normally. Unfortunately this year has been no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there appears to be no end to the deadlock amongst the Member States with regard to the financial perspective; we are at risk of reaching 2006 with no viable financial plan. The European Parliament must take precautions, because the application of Article 272 of the Treaty is, for the first time – I repeat, for the first time – a real possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we are presenting a draft budget which does not exceed the ceiling of the financial perspective, but which does get very close to it. And we are calling for an increase in payments and a use of the flexibility instrument that goes much further than the Council would like.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, who have presented a very courageous and innovative draft budget to the European Parliament, and I would ask them to maintain their positions at second reading and conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Dombrovskis, as rapporteur for other institutions, has incorporated most of our group’s priorities into his final resolution. One such priority was the retention of Parliament’s budget at the 20% level of heading 5. If used effectively, this benchmark provides us with the stability and rigour necessary for any budget. Moreover, we have increased the reserve allocated to property investment and we reserve the right to utilise the EUR 20 million reduction in the contingency reserve as a capital injection for any eventual purchase of new parliamentary buildings. The policy on acquisition of property was very successful and made much financial sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, the policy on communication and information was disappointing, since we have failed to convince European citizens that the European Parliament is representing their aspirations and their interests. In this year’s budget we have made available enough funds to start implementing, hopefully, an effective and citizen-friendly information strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, more needs to be done to improve the streamlining of an activity-based budget and to improve the efficiency of our operations. If we had to evaluate critically and objectively the impact of the ‘raising the game’ exercise, one has to acknowledge that a few of these objectives have actually been achieved. Realistically, however, there is no reason why, in the coming year, the administration should not achieve most of its stated targets. There is very little room for complacency. Bottlenecks should be eliminated and we have to sharpen our focus on the core operations, ensuring a more efficient use of our resources and cutting down on waste and duplication. Proper manpower planning, including redeployment, recruitment harmonisation and training services improvement should also be considered priorities in 2006. We need to initiate a prioritised plan catering for our future needs, bearing in mind that, with effect from 2009, we would have to budget over EUR 100 million per annum resulting from the Members’ Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">These changes and reforms should improve the quality and performance of our institutions. However, in the final analysis, one has to review this in terms of the impact on the new citizens, offering them a product with added value that meets their expectations and, in so doing, strengthens the image and credibility of the European Parliament and other institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does make a difference whether, for example, one invests in nanotechnology or guarantees a farmer his income – yes, I know, the CSU is living in another era.</p>

Mr Dombrovskis’ task was perhaps even more complicated, for he had a tough job to do within Parliament itself, there always being a difficult trial of strength between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau, and I believe that he has thoroughly fulfilled this task, even if it was sometimes difficult to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Since my colleague, Mrs Trüpel, has focused her speech on the general budget, I should like to focus mine on Parliament’s budget so as to put down a marker because, in my opinion, we are preparing to vote in favour of a rather absurd provision.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time in its history, Parliament is abandoning the theoretical threshold of 20% administrative expenditure. I am not abnormally attached to this figure but, nonetheless, I am going to make two or three remarks. Firstly, I do not wish to let it be said in this Chamber that, at the end of the year, the Bureau might urgently contrive an injection of the capital that we were unable to use. That is not the case. What we are really talking about is a long term policy, in accordance with which our Parliament wanted systematically to inject capital in order to buy property. Doing so has enabled taxpayers to make a saving of hundreds – and I mean hundreds – of millions of euros, because we bought our buildings at just the right time, instead of paying absolutely absurd rates of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution, our Parliament says that we are giving up EUR 20 million. On the other hand, it is also saying that it is ready to lay claim once again to this money from the Council if the money is required for buying property. I am going to leave this Chamber in exactly four minutes to go and negotiate the sale of some new buildings for Parliament. It is therefore already clear that we are going to need that money.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I can picture the Council laughing when it sees our request for an amended budget arrive, in which we lay claim to what we are rather hastily giving back to the Council today in order to make an outward gesture. Making an outward gesture is a very nice idea but, in truth, this EUR 20 million would enable us to inject capital and to make substantial savings. EUR 20 million divided up among Europe’s citizens – I calculated how much that came to – is a good four cents that we are giving back to every citizen. I believe that each citizen would be very pleased to receive these four cents. However, we could have used those EUR 20 million to carry out another policy. EUR 20 million is either too much or too little. As it happens, this is a particularly exceptional example of a situation not making sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Using what is termed the ‘ATHENA Mechanism’, the EU Member States pay the money for the EU’s military operations into a separate fund that is specifically not defined as a heading in the EU’s budget. In so doing, they leave Parliament on the outside looking in and make scrutiny almost impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Security and Defence Sub-Committee how much money there is in this fund, but have been given no answers. Now, therefore, I put that same question directly to the Council and the Commission. This procedure is currently being used for EUFOR Althea in Bosnia, and it is intended that it should in future be used specifically to finance what the EU calls its crisis management operations, which amount to waging war.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that the development aid budget was used to fund the EU’s questionable military and policing operations in the Congo and in the Sudan – or so, at any rate, it would appear from what the representatives of the Commission told the Foreign Affairs Committee. It was also stated at this meeting that the Treaty of Nice as it stands at present proscribes any independent military budget for the EU. Quite right too! Stop using financial trickery to fund military operations by the EU!</p>

Furthermore, what is the point of a debate about a 2006 budget which we all know will bear no relationship to the way the money will actually have been spent?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Auditors has, for good reason, refused to sign off the EU’s accounts for the last 10 years and said, in its last report, that 95% of the EU’s budget was open to fraud. Yet every year this House just shrugs its shoulders, sighs and looks the other way. That is a shameful indictment of this institution and demonstrates how pitifully useless it really is.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we start debating ways to spend next year’s money, I believe we should sort out the mess that has been left behind in previous years. Until the disgusting state of the EU’s finances has been sorted out, this House has no business debating further expenditure. I call upon you all, in good conscience, to reject the 2006 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After what I have heard in this House this morning, I want to state a very basic fact: we cannot, in any way, go back on our word as regards the common agricultural policy, in relation to the budget or to the WTO talks. We have signed off the common agricultural policy. We gave our word in Berlin in 2002 and we must keep our word. Our word should be our bond. To amend that in any way would mean to lose all credibility. That we cannot do in the context of development in rural Europe, which is as important as developing any other aspects of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like say, as did my colleague, the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Mrs Coughlan, and others, that we must keep the promise we made. Our promise on the CAP should not be in any way reneged on until 2013, as we said in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on the Peace II initiative. As Members of this House will know, the Peace II programme supports a range of political initiatives in Northern Ireland and in the border county region of Ireland. That peace programme has been vitally important to developments in my country. I want that to continue, along with the good work that this House and, indeed, the European Union have done for the peace programme, into the next round of structural funds between 2007 and 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteurs for their good work and hope that the continuation of the promises made will enhance the Union and the programmes that it has initiated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This obviously leads to a waste of energy on the part of the coordinators, such as Mr Garriga Polledo, on the part of Mr Lewandowski and on the part of</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> ... our overall rapporteur, Giovanni Pittella, who conducted the debate with refined skill and sharp Italian subtlety. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Consequently, year in year out, the problems remain the same: farming is under budgeted, and there continues – on the model of Krushchev in the 1960s - to be a discrepancy between the ambition of the Lisbon Strategy to develop the knowledge-based economy and the paltry amount of resources available. This means that Mr Pittella uses the introductory pages of his report to highlight just how pathetic the budget allocations of EUR 700 million for transport and EUR 650 million for education are. Even then, we remain more than EUR 2 billion below the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The cause is, of course, political but, above all, it is ideological: it is the rule according to which the budget has to be balanced in the short term, a foolishly mathematical rule that means that we do not have the resources to fulfil our ambitions. We should be moving not only towards a balance of the Maastricht kind, but also towards a long-term balance in the economic cycle and even towards a social balance. Hence, the obvious reason why the people of Europe are disappointed. Hence, the specific reason why, among 900 amendments, I tabled my Amendment 146, which has been endorsed by nearly all of the groups and which proposes establishing a European Mayors’ Day in order to entrench Europe in local democracy, a grass roots Europe that is to some extent a Europe of the people, characterised by solidarity and firmly rooted in its villages and in everyday democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is something of which I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House, lest we completely lose sight of that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in this House, we will also have to embark on something of a rethinking process. I take the line that we can no longer give more support across the board, but must concentrate on what really has to be done at European level and on the question of how much money can be made available for it. To Mrs Koch-Mehrin I would say, further to her calculations of how much goes on research and how much on agriculture, that she should take a look at all public budgets, and then she will see what an infinitesimal amount expenditure on agriculture represents in comparison with what is spent on research. The German Federal budget spends far more on research than it does on agriculture. When the figures are added up, these all cancel each other out. In this case, it is we who are responsible, and this budget must reflect that. The Member States have more responsibilities where research is concerned, and that is why their budgets reflect that. These calculations do not come out like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it perfectly clear, though, that if we require the Member States to keep to the stability criteria – which means making savings – that means that we in this House cannot go throwing money around all over the place. Not all Europe’s problems need a line in the European Budget to deal with them. Parliament will, in future, have to get used to making the sort of financial proposals that are the norm in national parliaments. If we manage to learn that lesson from the 2006 budget, then we will have achieved a great deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a radical report, but one to be commended for the timely emphasis it places on achieving the Lisbon goals and the need to improve the structural funds and external actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to make four points. Firstly, on information and communication: it is quite clear we need greater focus and direction. Therefore, I welcome Commissioner Wallström’s initiative to regenerate communication tools through the use of plan D, but stress that this will only be a success if adequate resources are made available. Therefore, I call on the Council to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the biggest challenge for this year’s budget and for future financing is in heading 4: External actions. Given the number of new regions where the EU has had to intervene recently, combined with the frequency and the destructive enormity of the natural disasters affecting largely poor countries and not least the recent earthquake in Pakistan and India, for which it is essential we increase resources next year, I believe there is a dire need for the Council and the Commission to have a thorough rethink on how these new areas are to be funded and, at the same time, how we are going to meet our obligations in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The situation as regards this heading is further exacerbated by an unwillingness to be more flexible vis-à-vis the sugar regime, where it is very important for us to help poor farmers, but, at the same time, it will add more pressure in heading 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst on agriculture, this brings me to my third point. I am extremely pleased that my amendment on reducing tobacco subsidies was adopted in the Committee on Budgets. This is a major step forward in finally putting an end to a hypocrisy within the European Union whereby, on the one hand, we have been funding health programmes warning of the ill effects of tobacco use and, on the other hand, subsidising tobacco production. This totally undermines the credibility of the EU and, adding insult to injury, a vast amount of the tobacco is burnt and destroyed because it is not good enough to be used. Therefore, I am calling on all colleagues to support this particular amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on Parliament’s budget, I must admit that I am somewhat perplexed by our strategy – or the lack of it – as it really is a shame that ...</p>

<p class="contents">Even though over 900 amendments were initially tabled, we have now agreed on a strategy that should be endorsed during tomorrow’s vote. We have succeeded in reaching this compromise despite the fact that 2006 is a challenging year from a budgetary point of view, for reasons that have already been mentioned. Expenditure has increased as a result of circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the start of the current Financial Perspective. Much credit is due to the rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, to the voluntary coordinators of the political groups, to the advisors of these groups and, of course, to the secretariat, headed by Mrs Fialho. The European Parliament has thus adopted a position, both on the 2006 annual budget and on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the EU governments acting through the Council. We expect them to reach a position on the multi-annual financial perspective, and we also expect them to ensure that the conciliation meetings to be held in November on the 2006 budget will not be wasted opportunities. A clear government mandate is required if these goals are to be achieved, and this will be a real test of the British Presidency. The mandate for conciliation on the 2006 budget is a test that the Presidency will face in November of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already sketched out its strategy. It is noteworthy that it includes confirmation of Parliament’s right to participate in 20% of administrative expenditure, while at the same time starting the search for ways in which Parliament itself could make savings.</p>
<p class="contents">We respect the Interinstitutional Agreement, and we are taking full advantage of its legal force. We are also making good use of the flexibility instrument, in accordance with Commissioner Grybauskaitė’s understanding of this mechanism.

<p class="contents">The budget for 2006 is being debated in the middle of a serious crisis of political orientation in the European Union, which was reflected in the impasse on the new financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Council of Ministers – now with the draft budget – has demonstrated huge political weakness once again. A serious question of credibility arises now, when political priorities are being set at European level and adequate funding is not then being safeguarded for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ministers for Finance again thought predominantly like accountants. We saw this in the linear reduction of appropriations with no political thought or criteria. Unfortunately, there was only one objective: for the overall budget not to exceed 1.01%. The drastically blinkered Council is addressing the budget as a lowest denominator for compromise rather than as a means of development, redistribution and solidarity and as a tool for implementing European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The question which arises, therefore, is political. Are the Council and the European governments getting the message from our peoples, from the citizens? Do they realise that it is only by strengthening policies which target development, employment, solidarity and cohesion – especially now following enlargement – that they will respond to the needs of European society?</p>
<p class="contents">We here in the European Parliament shall vote for the amendments which strengthen the Community budget and the policies which Europe and its peoples need today. However, that is not enough. Today, Europe needs a new progressive strategy and the corresponding budget to implement it. Today Europe needs to break away from conservative, managerial and neo-liberal perceptions. We need to project a new plan for Europe and to express the real political will to implement it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This budget will also be a bridge to the next financial perspective, on which there is no agreement at present. Parliament, of course, adopted its own negotiating position in its adoption of Mr Böge’s creditable report last spring.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important to secure funding for the EU’s future from the point of view of the major priorities, which are improved competitiveness in the Union, investment in research and development, and improvements in public safety. By investing in research and development, we are at the same time investing in the Union’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, completely forget the Union’s other policy areas. Agriculture will need a structural change in the future, but these changes must be made in such a way that agriculture can be practised in the future throughout the Union as a whole, including the peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent times have unfortunately shown that natural disasters are becoming more common. The Union budget should in future make better provision for this, so that we can react quickly both within the Union’s borders and outside them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dombrovskis, Parliament’s own rapporteur for the budget, should be congratulated for ensuring that Parliament sets a good example by budgeting according to real needs and not according to how much money might possibly have been spent on developing various more or less appropriate new schemes and projects. It is absolutely intolerable that the budget should be drawn up in such a way that 20%, by a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, should be spent every year, up to the last cent. An accountable Parliament inspiring public confidence drafts its budget with reference to real costs, not percentages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder if Mr Lewis could afford to adopt a similar attitude in the British House of Commons.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs, and in the one minute that has been allocated to me, I would mainly like to talk about democracy. In 2004, we reached an agreement with the Council about the common foreign and security policy, in which we undertook to hold high-level consultations on the content of that policy on a regular basis. The Council has never kept to that undertaking; never has there been any consultation at a high political level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council now takes the view that we have breached the gentlemen's agreement, because we have put a certain amount of that money in reserve, but I would beg to differ. I think it is the Council that has breached the gentlemen's agreement. This agreement is about both Parliament’s and the Council’s administrative expenses. I really fail to see how one could consider the expenses of the common foreign and security policy as administrative expenses. That is why democracy should verify these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget for next year does not support the achievement of these targets, but I truly appreciate the fact that the Council exceeded, even if only slightly, the notorious 1%. Therefore the Committee on Budgets, under the direction of the rapporteur, would increase next year’s payments by four billion, and we would be able to spend an extra 3.7 billion euros on cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Even after the acceptance of our proposal we are still well below the earmarked amounts specified in the applicable medium range draft general budget. If in the second round the Council does not support this merely symbolic extra expenditure, it acknowledges that it does not take national development plans seriously, that the new Member States have failed to learn from the mistakes of the first years and that governments who believe they are able to solve their own problems by holding back on the Union are still in the majority. This is a big mistake. The economy of Europe cannot be revived by cutting down on funds spent on the Union, but by a better utilisation of the opportunities provided by the Union. The solution is not less, but more Europe. Therefore I urge you, my fellow Members of the House, to support the proposal presented to us! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The current budget is hugely significant to Hungary and the other newly joined states. On the one hand, because it represents a transition to the 2007-2013 financial plan which will be defined within the framework developed by the European Parliament and will hopefully be accepted as soon as possible, and on the other hand because the representatives of all Member States have participated as equal members in the creation of this budget, from the preliminary work to completion. At long last, here we did not see the fifteen plus ten differentiation. In light of yesterday’s debates I do not think I need to emphasise the significance of this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Close cooperation was evident not only during Commission meetings, but also during conciliation sessions in the course of developing the 2006 budget and the 2007-2013 financial perspective. For the first time we were able to say that the 25 Member States are equal parties, that there are no differences between them. This is extremely important, as we can only build a common Europe if we work together.</p>
<p class="contents">The main figures of the 2006 budget in respect of Hungary have been known, they had already been determined through the Copenhagen Agreement. However, we were able to effect certain changes in these figures within the framework of the Agreement through the amendment proposals in order to reach our common European values. We are particularly pleased that following a Hungarian proposal we wish to ensure a larger allocation to Serbia, demonstrating that the EU does not only impose conditions, but also rewards their implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, deleting all the appropriations from one sector, such as tobacco, does not reflect the sensitivity which our Parliament has traditionally shown to the weakest groups of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this slender budget, with a 1% limit, does not allow us to exercise policy which is worthy of the ambitions of the Europe we want. Major Community objectives such as competitiveness, economic cohesion, sustainable development, small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation – basically, in other words, all the Lisbon objectives – have fallen victim to across-the-board cuts to the budget by the Council. At the same time, however, there have been cuts to the authority of the leaders of Europe themselves, who got everyone's expectations up and then capitulated unconditionally to the philosophy of austerity or, to be precise, to the philosophy of miserliness, not austerity, because austerity is when you cut the excess, when you cut the waste; but when you cut back on investments in the future and in hope, that is not called austerity, it is called miserliness.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have arrived at the point today where we have just EUR 13 million in our emergency fund. When? When all around us nature is avenging itself on man, when the frequency of earthquakes and fatal hurricanes has become the new global nightmare, we have tied our hands together instead of promoting the humanitarian solidarity of Europe internationally. Instead of leading, we are bringing up the rear.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Presidency may finally agree with the French by the end of the year. With a few painful compromises, it may perhaps close the financial perspectives. However, the idea of Europe will have gone bankrupt, in that, unfortunately, all our ambitious objectives for Europe will have been abandoned.</p>

I refer to the budget estimate for the European Ombudsman, which is the Petitions Committee’s responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s functions are of fundamental importance, involving as they do communication with the Community’s citizens and bringing its institutions closer to them. By examining the growing number of complaints relating to maladministration in the Community, and, where necessary, carrying out inquiries, he ensures that the rights and obligations of our fellow citizens are secured. His work helps to make the services rendered by the European authorities more transparent and of higher quality. It is therefore of fundamental importance that the European Ombudsman should be allocated sufficient funds to enable him to perform his functions as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Petitions Committee regards the increase in funding of 3% over against the 2005 budget as appropriate and defensible, particularly in terms of the increase in work across the board resulting from a rise in complaints and communications activity. The main reason why additional funding is needed, though, is in order to prepare appropriately for the accession to the Community of Romania and Bulgaria, and so we also endorse the call for additional staff to deal with enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget line does also, however, make it possible for the petitioners, that is to say the members of the public to claim, under certain circumstances, the partial reimbursement of up to 80% of their travel costs from Parliament’s budget, subject to the prior approval of the Chairman of the Committee. Subsistence costs for hotels and other expenses can also be reimbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee believes it to be necessary that such safeguards be put in place, as they have already had a beneficial effect on the Committee’s own capacities and improved its response to European citizens’ needs. We must not, therefore, be in any doubt about the fact that you cannot have more Europe for less money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
