Now Rule 111(2), explicitly states that the agenda can be altered by application of Rule 143, which has taken place, or on a proposal from the President, in other words you, Madam President. The word ‘or’, however, clearly denotes, in law, an alternative. In other words, if the agenda was altered by application of Rule 143, it cannot be altered again, quite obviously, by a proposal from the President. That is the reason why I have the strongest reservations about the legality of the vote which is about to take place, with many Members prevented from taking part in the debate. I think the Court of Justice should rule on this matter and I have no doubt that once again, Madam President, it will, sadly, reveal your rather light approach to your responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, cooperation must be encouraged in order to make it possible for the European Union and the Member States to fight against social exclusion and to eradicate poverty – social realities still unfortunately deeply affecting some Member States, such as my own, Portugal – in accordance with qualitative and quantitative targets to be agreed by the Council and Parliament. The Commission is to provide Parliament and the Council with information on the progress made within this programme annually. Encouraging dialogue with our partners in this area at European, national and regional levels so as to combat poverty and social exclusion more effectively, and maximising financial support for innovative projects with a European added value are determining factors for its success. In order to give full practical effect to the programme, providing for field inspections, the involvement of those suffering from social exclusion and poverty and funding for operations carried out by NGOs, it is essential to raise the reference amount to 100 million euro, including technical and administrative expenditure. Core funding for key European networks involved in these actions should also be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparation of an annual Round Table Conference of the European Union on social exclusion, organised in close collaboration with the Presidency of the Council of the Union and in consultation with all the actors concerned, is another essential initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to alert you to the insufficiency of the NGO financial control mechanisms, which will require closer supervision to ensure the strict and judicious application of public funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aim of this programme is to encourage the Member States to combine their efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe in a framework of open coordination. To be more effective, this coordination must be based on national action plans to combat exclusion, with guidelines established at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament examined this text at first reading in November last year under the French Presidency, which promoted a number of social affairs initiatives and was intent on making the fight against poverty a priority on the European social agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s common position fully or partially incorporates 25 of the 47 amendments adopted by Parliament during the sitting of 16 November 2000, while the Commission accepted 31 amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">To my great regret, the Council has rejected some of the most important amendments. It has rejected the reference to the revised Social Charter (1996) of the Council of Europe, to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must now be added. It does not want to retain the 90% funding for the activities to be carried out by the NGOs under the programme to combat poverty and social exclusion, bearing in mind that the same level of support has already been approved for the programme to combat discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding of the programme also represents a stumbling block. Believing that resources on a par with ambition are needed, the European Parliament hoped to increase the budgetary envelope from EUR 70 million to EUR 100 million, but in vain! Just as questionable is the refusal to involve the European Parliament explicitly in the monitoring of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I have naturally voted in favour of the amendments seeking to reinstate the provisions which were not endorsed by the Council and/or the Commission. Indeed, I think the programme ought to be as determined as possible. It should be an instrument for promoting equality of opportunity amongst all men and women, and send a strong political signal from the European Union. Just because our statistics for growth and employment are satisfactory overall, that is no reason to forget that far too many people still live on the margins of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is very important that we all work together in a spirit of cooperation so as to ensure that the problems of social exclusion are solved within our community.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I fully welcome the setting up of the new Social Protection Committee which is included as one of the changes within the Treaty of Nice. A Programme of Community Action to combat social exclusion must be fully supported. The European Union is economically strong, but there are still key social problems in many rural and urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment is quite concentrated in particular areas within the European Union. It is in fact concentrated in many specific blackspots. Putting in place initiatives to solve social exclusion and to give opportunities for the disadvantaged in our society must be a central policy of any government within the E.U.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle underpinning this new Community Action Programme is to create an open method of coordination between the Member States to help eradicate poverty and social exclusion. This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into National Action Plans and to implement policies to promote equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Social Policy Action Programme 2000-2005 as published by the Commission will also help in combating social exclusion. Particular emphasis will be placed on setting up schemes to help the long-term unemployed as well as to help early school leavers. There will also be continued national support for local job creation programmes under the principle of subsidiarity. There will also be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the Information Society, modern telecommunications services and Internet-related activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to build a two-tier Europe, or a Europe of the haves and have nots. It is very important that education and training opportunities are given to those without skills. It is equally important to give retraining opportunities to those in the existing workplace. Partnership is the key at all times and consultation between all interested parties is very important if the problem of social exclusion is to be solved sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel that the higher amount of funding proposed is essential if we are to be able to do serious work in tackling social exclusion and poverty. It is obvious that the current economic system is not delivering an adequate standard of living for many people within the EU, and before we push applicant countries in the same direction we have to know what we can do that is more effective in meeting people's needs. It is clear that we have a considerable number of working poor and people who will not be able to work at all, or work full-time and we need to see what can be done to ensure that they have an adequate income and other opportunities which allow them to participate in society. We cannot assume that work is the only activity that implies that you are a worthy citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Young people, those from minority ethnic groups, the elderly, people with disabilities, the homeless, the mentally ill and many others find themselves excluded in our societies in many different ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we support the rapporteur's view that there is a need for a wider body to evaluate the working of the action programme. We reject the view that only Member State governments should evaluate their own choices of research and other activities. They are not the poor and socially-excluded, so there is a role for civil society being involved in the evaluation to help ensure that the Commission and Member States are on the right lines in their approach and to provide greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament represent many of the poor and socially-excluded and also have valuable experience to bring to any evaluation. It is essential that we are given this opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, the ESDP management structures will be created, helping speed up the militarisation of the European Union, a process we reject and which is sufficient justification in itself for rejecting the current SAB and the Ferber report. Besides, Mr Ferber not only fails to question this process but he also ‘welcomes the Council’s decision to launch with this SAB a new European defence policy’ and also ‘regrets that this policy is not more integrated in the first pillar’.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also, however, institutional and technical issues to examine. Firstly, the entering of this operating expenditure as administrative expenditure of the Council both confuses the nature of the expenditure and removes the possibility of democratic control over it, specifically by Parliament, which, in practice, is thus giving up its budgetary power. However, in addition to the issues of democracy and transparency, there is increased pressure on the ceiling for expenditure under heading 5 – administrative expenditure – at a time when the European Union is preparing for enlargement. The motion for rejection tabled by the Group of the Greens only deals with these last two issues but essentially accepts the position of the Ferber report, without commenting on the basic issues of the ESDP. We cannot, therefore, vote in favour of this rejection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to accomplish things through being active and, furthermore, support must be obtained from members. For this reason I voted against donations by companies.

The obstinacy of the main federalist groups in pursuing their adoption come what may shows exactly how far the law is respected in the Europe they are building. The same can be said of the French government which, in its note of 9 May, sees no difficulty about using Article 308 in such a case.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of content, the proposed text turns the logical progress of a free society on its head. At national level political parties are created by the citizens and nurtured by their participation. They may eventually be granted public finance by law, but only later on. With this new text, the reverse would happen at European level: public finance from the Community budget would be intended to make European political parties – which do not exist today, or not with any real substance – ‘emerge’.</p>
<p class="contents">The perversion, however, does not end there. Next, these artificial creations will be used as evidence of the existence of a so-called ‘European political scene’, which will itself be produced as proof that ‘European democracy’ is working well. And this largely invented ‘European democracy’ will in turn serve to justify the removal of powers from the national democracies, the only truly genuine ones. This anti-democratic machine for despoiling the peoples is operating at full speed, activated in this case by the lure of gain, since the ectoplasms currently entitled ‘European political parties’, supported by their friends in the European Parliament, are waiting impatiently for the time when they can feed on public funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Added to these basic reasons for our opposition are many others relating to the irregularity of the text presented, because it gives a ‘statute’ to political parties which ought to remain free, because it is biased in favour of the partisans of supranationality, because it establishes a real political law, and because it institutes indefensible discrimination to the detriment of national parties acting directly at European level. Texts like these show how badly France needs a means of checking that acts derived from Community legislation are constitutional. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The pretext for the hurry is the EU's alleged concern at the increasingly poor turnout at elections. There is not a grain of truth in this argument, as is clear from the huge turnout at the recent elections in Italy and all the relevant studies, which talk of the disappointment and apathy of voters (due to the contradiction between what the bourgeois parties do and say) as regards the machinations going on in Brussels and Strasbourg. This alienation will increase even more when European parties with even looser ties to their voters are set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mainly using economic incentives as bait, legislation is being passed on what are, to all intents and purposes, binding rules governing the constitution and <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>of European parties. These strict binding rules concern both their statute and the electoral power which parties must have in order to qualify as ‘European’ and obtain the relevant funding. These parties must have clear European objectives, such as European integration, even if they appear to take the opposite approach. The word ‘appear’ is highly suspicious. Will a party such as the Communist Party of Greece, which not only appears but is, in fact, clearly opposed to European integration be approved? Further on it says that a political party cannot qualify as European if it preaches intransigence. In other words, is it prohibited to preach intransigence against fascism or, more importantly, against class enemies and the exploitation of the working classes?</p>
<p class="contents">As far as electoral power is concerned, the proposal is that the party must either have elected representatives in the European Parliament or in the national parliaments in at least 5 Member States (either in one third of the Member States or in one quarter according to today's resolution) or must have gained at least 5% in at least 5 Member States at the last European elections (either in one third or in one quarter of the Member States). This is direct interference in the electoral system of each country, because higher electoral quotas are being introduced which, in practice, will exclude the voices opposed to the so-called ‘European ideal’, that is, the imperialist nature of the ΕU.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, provision is made for contributions to be published for the sake of transparency. However, as there is no limit on contributions, we must assume that even the names of the members and friends of a party who pay a subscription will be recorded. The report considers the ban on donations to a party by public corporations to be something of an achievement in the transparency stakes. Woe betide that it should say the opposite! However, the problem lies in donations from the highly powerful private sector, on which it remains as quiet as the grave.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempt here to introduce compulsory European parties is tantamount to serious interference in the political system of each country, the aim being to weaken the role of the national parties, especially those which oppose the ΕU. The parties are institutions set up to express the free will of their members, as regards both their programmes and their <span class="italic">modus operandi</span>. By setting up European political parties as described above, they are trying to get the people to accept the imperialist integration of the EU as a one-way street, as destiny and as the only course available, to hit out at and – if they can – exclude any dissenting voices from the European Parliament and to distance the workers even more from the centres which take the decisions which directly affect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Real parties do not come into being because the structures of a state have a need for organising a competitive battle during elections, but because there are groups of people who share the same ideas, interests and activities. However, those in favour of a European multicultural state have discovered that there is no European public opinion. Artificially, from the top down, they now want to put forward leaders and structures which attempt to create an opinion of that kind. Four cooperatives of more or less like-minded parties in different Member States have now combined into a European party, and they support that party to some extent with funds from their common groups in this Parliament. In my view, this proposal is mainly a tool for legalising this unprofessional conduct. The doling out of tax money to parties, as well as the imposing of rules on parties by the government adds to the mistrust on the part of the citizens against what they see as a political elite. A centralistically organised European party could well create a situation where, within a joint political movement, member involvement, party democracy and the priorities which differ from Member State to Member State are being compromised. Although I welcome the fact that this proposal does not discriminate on the basis of their political persuasion and their scale, and that gifts from businesses are prohibited, I will be voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statutes have the effect of being democratically and financially exclusive and also appear to be discriminatory in as much as high thresholds are introduced for determining whether a party is to be counted as a European party. Thus, they do not safeguard justice for minorities and the protection of the latter. There is also an obvious danger, along the lines of American policy, in companies being granted the right to provide financial subsidy to what have been approved as European political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Not until the end of 2001 at the earliest will all 15 Member States’ parliaments and governments have ratified the Treaty of Nice. Only then will it be possible for the issue of the financing of European political parties to be dealt with in detail by the European Parliament. Today’s decision is premature.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg will examine and ascertain whether Article 308 of the Treaty really can be invoked as a legal basis. It is my conviction that today’s decision will then be declared as being contrary to the Treaty and thus repealed.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 308 reads: ‘If action by the Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and this Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures.’</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament believes that, to be eligible for subsidy at European level, financed by taxation, a party association must have obtained at least five per cent of the vote in at least a third of the Member States or be represented in the European Parliament or national or regional parliaments in a third of the Member States. The Commission does not want a relative number, but a fixed number, of Member States (five, irrespective of the size of the EU).</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has made the democratic threshold remarkably high, too high in fact. Large groups of citizens, with representatives in the European Parliament, may be excluded from this financing of parties at European level through taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording in Article 3 concerning the approach to European political associations and national parties bears witness to a view of the future which I cannot in any way share: ‘the party or its national components’.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the European Parliament has, then, established the national political parties as future ‘national components’ or types of district organisation of what are being called European political parties and which taxpayers around Europe are expected to subsidise.</p>
<p class="contents">Developed as it was by pioneers with a strong spirit of self-sacrifice, perseverance and faith in the fundamental importance to society of the Christian ethic and view of human beings and of the family, Sweden’s Christian Democratic Party, led by Birger Ekstedt at the beginning of 1964 and by Alf Svensson from 1973, is far too significant and important in terms of democracy to be described as ‘a national component’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Democracy means, first and foremost, respect for the law. Everyone knows perfectly well, even those who claim the contrary, that this plan for financing European political parties has no legal base. Article 191, as Mr Berthu has shown, cannot be used as a base for implementing Article 308. Court of Justice case law on this point is as clear as day. There is no Community competence. The majority of this Parliament, however, like the Commission, pretends not to know that, because there is so very much at stake for the federalist parties and the federalist ideology. What all this is really about is, on the one hand, the cash flow of several large parties whose members’ subscriptions no longer suffice to maintain their bureaucracies, and which are tightly confined by strict national anti-corruption provisions, and, on the other, the creation of a new instrument of forced federalisation which will limit the peoples’ freedom of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, democracy means transparency. There is a danger that the system of financing for supranational European parties proposed by the Commission and the Schleicher report will constitute an exceptional channel for corruption and in particular for money laundering, since companies can make unlimited donations and the conditions for accepting donations from individuals are extremely lax. European financing would therefore make it possible to by-pass and thwart national efforts to clean up the funding of political parties and apply strict conditions to make it transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy is also respect for minorities. It is extremely disturbing that the debate on the Schleicher report, after being declared inadmissible by Parliament, was forcibly restored to the agenda this morning by an arrogant majority with minimal concern for respecting the law, as shown by Mr Barón Crespo’s alarming description of the minority in this Parliament as a ‘commando’. The majority of a Parliament that prides itself on teaching the whole world to respect minority rights would do well to start by respecting the minority within it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission deliberately and wittingly overlooks these consequences and does not even brook the idea of repeating intervention so as to secure a minimum wage for olive producers. It has not proposed any increase in quotas so as to at least cover existing production, preferring instead to focus on the quality of olive oil, as if the healthiest and most suitable product for consumers' health has been totally unsuitable in the past. The Commission's alleged interest in the quality of olive oil is misleading and hypocritical. If it is so interested in quality, why does it allow olive oil mixed with different seed oils to be marketed? Because that way large quantities of seed oil are sold, which have nothing in common with the nutritional value of olive oil and because that way the industry and the multinationals make more profit. What makes the Commission's deliberate undermining and blatant hypocrisy obvious is that it examines the application of measures, such as the subsidy per tree, with total indifference as to the disastrous consequences which this will have on the olive groves themselves, the quality of the product and the employment and income of the producers.</p>
<p class="contents">And all this at a time when the Commission is arranging for mixing, that is, the adulteration of olive oil, to be legalised, is working to abolish the transportation and marketing of olive oil in cans of more than 5 litres on the pretext of avoiding adulteration, as if olive oil in cans of less than 5 litres cannot be adulterated. In other words, this measure is not intended to improve quality but to allow the industry and the multinationals to monopolise the marketing and transportation of olive oil.</p>
<p class="contents">We need changes to the common organisation in the market in olive oil and for what is a catastrophic situation for olive producers to be reversed, not a few isolated interventions in secondary issues. Unfortunately, the Commission is able to cover up its unacceptable action with the collusion of the Greek government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be the case that at all points people involved in criminal processes achieve the highest level of respect for their rights of defence.</p>

This cooperation excludes any action by an authority against Member States, and any desire to integrate national judicial systems. Its purpose is to make all the various legal players work better together, and its context is clearly intergovernmental.</p>
<p class="contents">We approve of this approach, because it is the most realistic. There is no dream of any general merging of national legal systems – an impossible dream, which would only delay practical solutions – but, on the contrary, a determination to work from the basis of the existing judicial networks, by removing technical obstacles which might hinder fluid relations between them.</p>
<p class="contents">For once a report by Parliament appears to rally to a realistic approach, and does not reject an initiative out of hand, as it has tended to do recently, under the pretext that it has come from the Member States and not the Commission. The report does not make the customary demand for a supranational European public prosecutor, a unified body of law, or indeed federal criminal courts. For once it seems to accept the intergovernmental approach as the most viable, and we can only rejoice at that.</p>
<p class="contents">This apparent moderation, however, conceals several traps. First, the amendments proposed by the European Parliament seek to strengthen centralisation around the Eurojust unit, notably by seeking to eliminate the national correspondents, thus surreptitiously renouncing the ‘network’ idea, on which the system is supposed to be based. And above all, these amendments totally undermine the intergovernmental spirit, transforming the applications for investigations or prosecutions issued by Eurojust into decisions binding on the Member States, and eliminating their whole margin of manoeuvre in applying the law in their own territory. As we see it, this surreptitious transformation of the original text is utterly unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With all kinds of organised and cross-border crime on the increase, however, with growing insecurity and violence, intergovernmental cooperation between Member States’ police forces and judiciaries is desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lo and behold, though, Europe is trying to impose communitisation of our judicial system and our internal public order on the pretext of this cooperation, notably by creating a European public prosecutor’s office. The Nice Council of December 2000 adjudged this latter measure a danger to respect for individual’s rights and democracy, and rightly rejected the creation of this supranational public prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is once again treating the deep feelings of the Member States with disdain. Following the old custom of coming through the back door in disguise after leaving through the front, it is actually trying, with the help of Mrs Guigou, French Minister of Justice at the time, to make Eurojust an embryo European public prosecutor’s office. A single prosecution service, independent of the Member States could therefore, at its convenience, decide to arrest, prosecute or extradite suspects, without any recourse to the judiciaries of the Member States concerned.

<p class="contents">The joint resolution on the Middle East, as it now stands, recognises what has become an unbearable situation for the Palestinians in the occupied areas, who are being made to suffer unbearable and unfair collective punishment. It condemns the illegal incursions by the Israeli army, the extrajudicial executions, the complete blockade of the occupied territories and the extension of the settlements there. It makes special mention of Israel's practice of marketing products from the settlements in the occupied territories as produce of Israel, so that it qualifies for Community preferences, and it calls for measures to be taken. It considers that the disproportionate use of violence by the Israeli army and collective punishment are incompatible with the principles of the Association Agreement between the ΕU and Israel. It calls for all settlement procedures to be frozen, including the natural increase in the population and it calls on the Member States to propose that the UN Security Council send observers and take a stand in favour of the creation of a Palestinian state.</p>

Since 29 September 2000, the date of Ariel Sharon’s provocative act in the Mosque compound (Haram al-Sharif), the Israeli army of occupation has already caused hundreds of deaths, mostly children and adolescents, injured tens of thousands and arrested hundreds of Palestinians who are fighting to make their right to a have a State a reality. In the escalating aggression, Israel destroys Palestinian houses, continues its policy of occupation and the illegal building of settlements, restricts the free movement of Palestinian communities, drops bombs, sets up road blocks, does not fulfil financial commitments or signed agreements, carries out selective assassinations, invades territories under the administration of the Palestinian authority and attacks Syrian forces in Lebanon, attracting the strongest condemnation.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, Israel has occupied Palestinian territories since 1947. Since 1967, it has occupied Gaza and the West Bank, forcing thousands of Palestinians to live outside their country, a situation which is condemned by the UN and only maintained through the support of the USA and with at least the connivance of the EU. Peace will only be possible when the UN resolutions are fully implemented and the Israeli aggression comes to an end.

<p class="contents">In today’s edition of the French newspaper, <span class="italic">Libération</span> (16 May 2001), one of Israel’s best known pacifists, the writer David Grossman, observes that, if one does not believe in miracles and does not approve of catastrophes, there is only one way to change the situation in the Middle East, namely through ‘international pressure’. He also states that it is Israel, the occupying power, which is mainly responsible and therefore in greatest need of external pressure. Because the United States never does anything that Israel does not like, there is an important international role waiting to be fulfilled in this area. The EU has for a long time been the biggest provider of economic and administrative aid and the most important supporter of the Palestinian Authority. EU politicians have complained that the EU does not play a corresponding political role. Why, then, not take up the gauntlet and do what the United States does not want to do and what both Palestinians and Israeli pacifists are pleading should be done, that is to say bring specific pressure to bear upon Israel?</p>
<p class="contents">Formal bases in international law for economic sanctions against Israel are to be found in the shape of those infringements of Israel’s Association Agreement with the EU, demonstrated by the Commission with reference to the fact that goods from unlawful Israeli settlements on occupied land are being sold to the EU with ‘Israel’ cited as the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">If, now, it really is the case that the EU’s new rapid reaction force does not exist at all to protect the EU’s interests as a superpower but, in fact – and as Mrs Lindh usually maintains – is there simply to be unselfish about making peace in the world, why not propose that it be deployed in the Middle East along the only lawful dividing line between Israel and Palestine, namely the 1967 frontier?</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, nothing of this was heard when Mrs Lindh presented the EU’s Middle East policy before the European Parliament today. There were a whole lot of words, but absolutely nothing concrete and nothing which could in any way put an end to the bloodbath and to the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine. The matter is made that much the more tragic by the fact that Sweden’s own voice on the subject of Palestine has gone completely silent. The work of the former Foreign Minister, Mr Andersson, is being carried on not by Mrs Lindh but by her Danish colleague, Mr Lycketoft, who now talks in no uncertain terms about Israel’s violation of human rights and of international law. Both in her capacity as EU President and as Swedish Foreign Minister, Mrs Lindh appears, rather, to have capitulated before those forces which do not dare to stand up to Israel and the United States. That is deplorable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the attacks that then provoke reactions from the Israeli state, which responds with measures that are perhaps disproportionate compared with the attacks that caused them. Where violence rules, however, it is difficult to classify it according to a scale of values and condemn only those who use it to defend themselves. I feel uncomfortable in approving the so-called compromise resolution. I find too many condemnations of Israel in it. It is not a resolution that expresses an equal distance from the parties in question. It is a document that upholds the rationale of just one side and belies the good will demonstrated on many occasions by the Israeli leaders. Besides, it is easy to see that whenever the peace process was about to resume, the terrorist extremists went into action. And Europe never spoke up at times like that. The ‘principle of reciprocity’ on which agreement was reached in Oslo in 1993 must be safeguarded. Dialogue, mutual understanding, condemnation of violence are elements characterised by an action that favours resumption of the process. Europe, and primarily our institutions, must not assume the role of judge but rather that of a credible and authoritative interlocutor, if it wants to contribute effectively to the peace process.</p>

The Pensioners’ Party is asking that social security, which is financed out of our wages, out of workers’ pay, should be voluntary and not compulsory.

First of all, the report turns social security into a Community issue in terms of policy development and policy measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing so, the report imposes a certain vision: the pursuit of social convergence. Consequently, Member States are afforded little scope for creating their own solutions. It is precisely the diversity of systems that requires every Member State to use its own tailored approach. Many large Member States still need to restructure their provisions for old age in the light of the ageing population.</p>
<p class="contents">The supra-national aspects affect the pre-conditions, such as the budgetary implications and the requirement that saving for a pension in one Member State should not hinder mobility to another Member State. We have more than enough to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">If the reforms are to be accompanied by coordination efforts for a European social security system, this will seriously hamper the reforms, and will stand in the way of an effective solution. It should be noted in this connection that the enlargement is already taking up a considerable amount of the limited resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, the report is not in touch with reality. Pensions will thus become unsafe, untenable and unaffordable. Indeed, no one wants to be worse off, and the system which offers most facilities should be taken as the guiding principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The document by the European Commission, on the other hand, gives a clear analysis of the issue. The Commission document has a much more targeted approach. The report is thus no improvement on the Commission document.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have decided against giving our support to this report, which is only detracting from the sound approach in the Commission communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission communication and the report by Mr Cercas undoubtedly contain important and positive proposals. The calls for better social protection for women are a case in point. However, as regards the basic problem – defending and renewing social protection systems based on solidarity – the report conflicts with the fundamental positions held by our group.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore cannot vote for the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The general emphasis on solidarity is clearly at odds with the specific proposals. The majority of Members of the European Parliament fully support the shift away from statutory pensions schemes based on solidarity towards a three-pillar model of pensions provision. The report does not develop any fundamental alternatives to the pensions reform initiated by the decisions taken at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, which lacked a social framework. I think it is especially tragic that by promoting the partial privatisation of pensions systems based on solidarity, European social democracy is breaking radically with its entire historical tradition. For more than a hundred years, social democracy has fought for a redistributive welfare state based on solidarity. Now it is at the forefront of the campaign to dismantle it.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis on demographic arguments, such as the 'greying' of the European societies, is not convincing. Furthermore, no attempt is made to examine other options – such as the inclusion of all types of income in financing the pensions system, as in Switzerland – in terms of their viability.</p>
<p class="contents">'Live longer, save more, spend less!' These are the watchwords of the 'pensions reform'. The Commission and the High-Level Working Party on Social Protection are calling for new regulations to push back the current retirement age. In future, the statutory pension will no longer maintain a person's existing living standards in old age, but will merely offer basic provision.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining pensions systems based on solidarity is possible even under current and future conditions as long as policies are guided by the principle of social justice rather than the self-seeking interests of banks, investment funds and insurance companies. We therefore see no reason why we should go along with the proposed change of strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been as a result of evidence which has been forthcoming by scientific communities, both in America and in the European Union. The fact of the matter is simply this. People are living longer. People are leading healthier lives. People know what foods they should eat in an effort to promote healthy living and, in its simplest terms, people are living longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people retire from work at the age of 55 and the fact of the matter is that EU governments are going to have put in structures to ensure that future pensions can be paid to public servants. Equally, those working in the private sector will have to look more carefully at their pension plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome a recent study carried out by Merril Lynch, a leading US bank, which stated that Ireland tops the European league for safeguarding future pension payments. One per cent of our GDP is now being put aside per annum into what is known as the National Pension Reserve Fund so as to ensure that pensions for our public servants can be paid after the year 2025. Per annum we are now paying as much as £600 – £700 million pounds into this fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is important that we not only promote good savings programmes in our country but also ensure that people take out a pension at an early age. I am aware that EU leaders discussed this matter when they met in Stockholm recently. It is incumbent on all the governments of the European Union to bring forward legislation which can ensure primarily the payment of public service pensions into the future and secondly, to promote good pension programmes for the private sector. If this entails giving more tax breaks for persons so as to encourage them to take out pensions in the private sector, so be it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now as is well known, there has been no lack of catastrophic visions for the future of social protection, based on the ageing of the population and increased life expectancy. Although the report does not distance itself enough from the more negative positions of the Commission, particularly when it refers to the need for greater flexibility in pension systems, it does highlight the importance of the rise in the employment rate and of public systems based on intergenerational solidarity, and a fair balance between proportional contributions and benefits, on the one hand, and the principle of solidarity, on the other, in order to prevent poverty and social exclusion. It also takes up the 1992 recommendation concerning the minimum income to be guaranteed by the social protection systems, by supporting initiatives for its implementation. However, the report does not go far enough regarding what needs to be put into practice in terms of economic and social policies so as to effectively ensure that public systems are sound enough and guarantee worthwhile pensions.

Even if we agree that the vital demographic challenge facing Europe as a whole today is a crucial issue for the Member States, the very least we can say is that we disapprove of the pseudo-solutions which you propose in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has managed to duck the issue in 31 convoluted paragraphs. At no point is there any talk of encouraging the birth rate in Europe or promoting real family policies.

<p class="contents">The debates about the equal treatment of women and men in social security, which have been ongoing since 1975, have borne witness to the usefulness and importance of the European Union's support, through its equal opportunities and equal treatment policies, in dismantling discrimination against women in pensions provision.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that our proposals will be taken seriously by governments facing the challenge of safeguarding living standards through adequate pensions for all, and that they will lead to Europe-wide cooperation on pensions issues.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the goals of the Lisbon Process is to increase the number of women in the workforce. Those who lament the low numbers of working women – in my country too – often forget the millions of 'invisible' women working in the 15 EU countries, namely the wives who work in family businesses and who do not appear in the employment statistics. For many years, we have called for framework legislation at European level for spouses who work in family businesses, especially to guarantee their statutory participation in pensions schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to call attention once more to our demand that women's derived rights to a widow's pension be safeguarded, especially for the generations who had no access to employment and who worked solely in the home. Naturally, I believe that women should increasingly build up their own individual pension rights. However, this means that spouses who take a break from or opt out of paid employment to care for children or dependent relatives must have guaranteed pension entitlements based on the right to continue paying their social insurance contributions during maternity leave, parental leave, etc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that working is threatening to turn into a kind of elite sport, people end up being burnt-out at a younger age, and the need for a lower pensionable age is growing. In addition, due to small families, younger generations are outnumbered by the older generations, as a result of which, fewer people will be working per pensioner in future. The wrong answer to that has come from most governments and businesses over the last few decades. They wanted to reduce the number of people entitled to pensions, by, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, abolishing widows’ pensions, and by starting the old-age pension at an older age. In this way, it was hoped that taxes and pension premiums would drop. It has now become clear that skimping on pension rights only leads to poverty in the long run. The only way to stave off that poverty then is to suddenly raise government spending sharply. The real answer is to start saving in good time for a general pension right for everyone at the age of 60, and to improve pensions caused by inability to work at a younger age.

<p class="contents">Using the "challenges posed by the ageing of the population", which extends the period of retirement and has an adverse effect on business activity, as a pretext, it promotes the gradual implementation of the Stockholm decisions on drastic intervention in social security systems: part-time employment, the abolition of early retirement, benefits indexed to contributions, harsh cuts in benefits, a longer working life and an increase in the retirement age or the number of years' contributions required before full retirement, the gradual dismantling of the welfare state and the promotion of alternative private care and welfare systems.</p>

Fleecing the workforce, insecurity, expensive private care, commercialising the pension system, poverty and social exclusion. That is what is in store for the workers, while big business, which demands that the social security system be sacrificed in order to safeguard its competitiveness, can look forward to a more robust, completely unaccountable and hugely profitable future.</p>
<p class="contents">The break up of the social security system, in conjunction with working time arrangements geared to employers' interests, that is, part-time work and ‘flexible’ working times, are the terrifying reality of what was so cynically referred to in Stockholm as "the need to reduce bottlenecks in the labour market", that is, the creation of a huge army of employable people with no rights and no demands who must dance to the tune of big business with its speculative, competitive interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The reaction of Greek workers and the Greek people as a whole to the abolition of the welfare state, the mass, combative rallies and strikes taking place, even as we speak, are a most resonant and categorical response to leaders laying disgusting plans without any thought for the people affected. The Greek workers have said the first resounding and steadfast "no" to the poverty and insecurity in store for them. We are positive that all the workers of Europe will say the same and we shall be at their side. You are sowing an anti-grass roots storm and you will reap a grass-roots hurricane. However, you can be sure that what you are trying to do will not wash! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of them, however, did not trust me and followed me by plane to see and hear how I would vote in this round. He is that gentleman in the red jacket you can see amongst the people in the public gallery; if you cannot see him it is because pensioners can only be seen when they are amongst themselves. I want to reassure him that I also voted for the European Parliament budget for 2002, although I still think that part of this funding should be used to have our plenary session seen on television throughout Europe. I think we should finance live broadcasts of the sittings of the European Parliament with all its trials and tribulations but also all its importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
