<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buitenweg (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I shall be discussing both documents together, not only that on Parliament’s budget but also that on the Convention, a report which I drafted together with Mr Costa Neves, for both reports are closely connected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention on the European Union’s future commences tomorrow. We are therefore in good time to commit the funding for this. The Convention offers a good opportunity to obtain a more decisive institution, to bring about more efficiency in this House and also to increase the legitimacy of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of such a meeting of representatives of Parliament and governments was born here in this House. The European Parliament sets great store by the success of this Convention. This is one of the reasons why we agreed to an accelerated procedure. I therefore hope that Parliament makes it possible for the supplementary and amending budget No 1/2002 to be approved tomorrow, to coincide with the start of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to single out a few details of the Convention’s budget. The Council’s Secretariat-General has made an estimate and arrived at an amount of approximately EUR 10.5 million for a 10-month period, until December 2002. Part of this amount, EUR 6.5 million, will be payable by the participants: the three institutions – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – and the governments and parliaments of the Member States or the candidate countries. This, for example, covers all kinds of travel expenses which are usually borne by the institutions or the national governments. This leaves us with a balance of some EUR 4 million. This is the amount which actually matters for this is the Convention’s own budget.</p>
<p class="contents">How will this EUR 4 million be managed? It is only a small amount, of course, but, politically speaking, it is very important for the three institutions to have a sufficient say in the budget. On a limited, practical level, it goes without saying that the Convention and its Praesidium will decide on how this budget will be spent. But if expense funds are moved elsewhere, for example if more funding is needed for daily expenses, to the detriment of the forum for NGOs and citizens, then that is a political matter. Then it is important, particularly for a Parliament which wants to play an important role in the Convention, to have a say in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, however, is that the Convention itself has no legal basis and that the normal budgetary principles did not, therefore, apply. The Member States insisted that Parliament and the Council should not form the two arms of the budgetary authority, but that the EU Member States as a whole should have the final word.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this was inopportune for us, we showed an understanding of this problem in the negotiations and arranged matters in such a way that the Member States were eventually able to give their seal of approval, though not before the three institutions had given their <span class="italic">avis conforme</span>. Accordingly, the Member States can only approve something if the three institutions agree. As a result, the European Parliament has acquired the right of veto, we have a say in the budget, we also have the right to information and to peruse documentation, we can give discharge and such like, and we have therefore, in practice, held on to the important achievements of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very aware that this solution is not very attractive on the surface. We would, of course, have preferred it if the amount had been included in the budget in the normal way, but this is how it was, for there was no legal basis. Seen against this backdrop, I therefore think that the Committee on Budgets has achieved a very respectable result.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, there has been some criticism. I was at the Bureau today and, there too, concern was expressed about the role of Parliament and about the implications of Parliament not answering to the Council but to the Member States as a whole. There was also concern in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. This is the reason why we have included a long amendment in the resolution which expressly states the achievements of the agreement and which also states that this agreement <span class="italic">in sui</span> has no legal character. It forms an exception, an agreement that only applies to this particular situation. I hope that this addition, in which we expressly state that the agreement is an exception, as well as the fact that we managed to retain Parliament’s say in the budget after all, will lead to wide support for this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work has been carried out swiftly and, in my opinion, well. Given the need to ensure that all the factors that might contribute to the effectiveness of the Convention’s works are put in place in good time, its budgetary framework has already been defined, in accordance with the rules of transparency and institutional balance. The particular nature of the Convention explains the specific characteristics of its legal and budgetary frameworks, revealed immediately by the very existence of the ‘Fund’, and by the fact that this is subject to exceptional financial rules. Particular account has therefore been taken of the temporary nature of the new body and the requirement for greater flexibility has been met.</p>
<p class="contents">The factors I have mentioned form the basis of a specific interinstitutional agreement, which defines, in particular, the sum of the contributions from the institutions providing the finance, which are Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as Mrs Buitenweg already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the terms of the agreement reached in the trialogue of 18 February, the full involvement of Parliament is, therefore, guaranteed at all stages of the life of the ‘Fund’, (created by intergovernmental decision) – it must be stressed – particularly with regard to the processes of transferring appropriations and of discharge. The exceptional nature of the initiative and, as a correlation, that of the applicable rules is perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by thanking all my fellow Members for their cooperation, and I would specifically like to highlight the work of those who took part in the trialogue, Reimer Böge and Kathalijne Buitenweg, as well as the contribution of the Committees on Constitutional Affairs and on Budgetary Control, which helped to focus attention on certain aspects. I also hope that, by means of this budgetary procedure, we will remain associated with a Convention that could well make history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make it clear that I am speaking primarily on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control. The rapporteurs – whom I also wish to congratulate on their work – have both pointed out that the Committee on Budgetary Control gave this matter very careful consideration and this is reflected in the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">We did so because we want the proceedings of the Convention to be a success. This is our unanimous view, and I would like to make that clear. On this basis, we will be voting for the supplementary and amending budget which is contained in the report submitted to this House by the Committee on Budgets. However, it must be clear that this extraordinary budgetary procedure is a one-off; under no circumstances can it constitute a precedent for the future. This has been emphasised by the rapporteurs. Furthermore, the budgetary transactions must be conducted with maximum transparency and clarity, not least in order to justify the trust and hopes invested in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Committee on Budgets is satisfied with the agreed procedures, a number of key issues remain unresolved as regards budgetary control. We have set these out in our statement, which was drafted in great haste, and we note that some of these points have been included in the resolution, for which we are grateful. The main concern, from our point of view, is the granting of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget which, under the Treaty, is the prime and sole decision of Parliament and is normally non-negotiable. Yet Article 20 of the Council Decision on the financing of the Convention states that the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States shall give a discharge to the Secretary-General of the Convention, after Parliament, the Council and the Commission shall have consented thereto. What exactly does this mean, given that the terms assent or <span class="italic">avis conforme </span>are not defined in the various language versions? What procedures are envisaged for this process? A satisfactory solution has yet to be found in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which inevitably arises is Parliament's access to documents. The Treaty clearly states that the Parliament must receive all documents and information which it deems necessary to the discharge resolution procedure. Yet Article 4 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets merely refers to the Court of Auditors in this context. This does not reflect the spirit of the Treaty. As has already been noted, this is a <span class="italic">sui generis </span>procedure which diverges in part from the Treaty. Nonetheless, Parliament must have full and free access to all documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Article 5 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets, which stresses that budgetary procedures, in particular on discharge, will have to comply with ordinary law, should the Convention's remit be extended beyond the period originally projected. I would like to reiterate my hope that we will be able to adopt this report tomorrow and thus get the Convention off to a good start . </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we have to vote on a supplementary and amending budget which, without doubt, is, and will remain, unique in the history of this Parliament, for we are negotiating a figure which amounts to 0.005% of the European Union budget and have even arranged a debate specifically for this purpose. We asked Commissioner Schreyer to appear before this House to discuss the reports and the action we are taking. There is good reason to discuss these matters, for they concern the financing of the Convention. This House pushed harder than any other European institution for the setting up of the Convention; we promoted and demanded it. We demanded it because we believe it is necessary to develop and introduce new procedures in Europe in order to improve interinstitutional relations and the interdependence between the three institutions. This means that there must be mutual respect, an awareness of roles, and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency's initial proposal on the management of the funds necessary for the financing of the Convention alarmed us all, for it stipulated that the Council alone would provide the money, administer it and – above all –monitor how it is spent. It made no reference at all to Parliament! Of course, under no circumstances can this be a precedent for future relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Committee on Budgets and this House firmly rejected this model. In doing so, we had to adopt an accelerated procedure as there was no time to follow our usual procedure. Indeed, we had to involve coordinators to discuss the matter. We could not even make proper preparations within the Committee on Budgets. Nonetheless, we did so because we were keen to ensure that the Convention could be launched tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">What this House has achieved is to ensure that in conformity with our powers, we are now part of the budgetary authority as regards the allocation of funds. We are one of the two elements of the budgetary authority whose task is to decide on the allocation of funds. Transfers of funds can only be carried out with our consent, which is also necessary for the granting of discharge. This gives rise to other issues and we have discussed these as well. In the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the solution identified is a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, however, gone one better, for our colleagues from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control have added an extra dimension, which is all to the good. We will certainly ensure that the procedure adopted for the Convention, and the implementation of this procedure, do not become a blueprint for any other institutions which may be set up at European level at any time in the future. One existing institution – namely Coreper – will assume a function which has not been assigned to it at all at European level. It will be the body to which Parliament, the Council and the Commission grant the right to consent to discharge. It is astonishing: the Council will grant consent for the discharge of Coreper – one of its own institutions! This is very bizarre. This will not be a blueprint for any future arrangements in the European Union, and the discharge procedure will not be carried out on this basis in any other context. We will vigorously resist any moves in this direction. Parliament will defend its rights, and we will monitor developments very closely. However, we will vote in favour of the report tomorrow because we recognise that the Convention must be able to start its work. It is important to send out a positive signal to Europe by demonstrating that we are no longer applying the old procedures but are adopting a new approach, a new direction, and are shaping the future of Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have therefore witnessed a complete change from the sluggishness of the decision-making process for which, with good reason, we are often blamed. Having said this, the funds are community funds raised by the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Without giving a value judgment here about the Convention phenomenon, it is evident that it entails costs. Given the Convention’s working method, the lion’s share of these costs, however, will be accounted for in terms of the normal activities of national parliaments and European institutions. This does not detract from the fact that these costs should also be made transparent, like those required for making infrastructure available.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither the Convention’s character, nor the urgency, can absolve the Council or Parliament from their joint responsibility for the EU budget. This fund of EUR 4 million should also be spent in a transparent and effective manner and will, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, cover the costs of the chairman and the secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely at a time when the remuneration of expenses is high on the agenda in this House, it is important that the Convention too pursue a responsible policy. Reports about exorbitant remuneration can best be refuted if transparency is in place. There should certainly not be a whiff of profiteering surrounding a project concerning Europe’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no objections, as long as this fund still has a healthy balance at the end of 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Convention on the future of the European Union will shape the face of Europe. I am pleased that it has been possible to reach an agreement, an understanding, on its financing despite the misleading speculation at the outset, especially concerning the amount of funding necessary. As has already been mentioned, the costs for this year are estimated to total EUR 10.5 million. Part of these costs will be covered by the Member States or candidate countries, namely the travel expenses for their members. Most of the costs will, however, be borne by the European institutions. I should particularly like to mention Parliament's contribution here, which will be provided as infrastructure resources, namely translation and interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">One estimate reveals that a further EUR 4 million will be required for other sundry expenses. What are these other sundry expenses? They include, for example, the funding of any studies which may be required, or, perhaps, additional translation services. The estimate thus stands at EUR 4 million, and a consensus has been achieved very quickly on how these EUR 4 million are to be provided: EUR 400 000 from the Council, EUR 1 million from Parliament, and EUR 2.6 million from the Commission. These resources will be paid directly, via the supplementary budget, into a fund which will then be available to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that with the Interinstitutional Agreement, to be signed tomorrow, our discussions have resulted in an arrangement which will ensure extraordinary transparency. In this way, all three institutions will be involved in setting the budget for the Convention, making any amendments to this budget, and granting discharge. In this context, the prior assent of all three institutions will be required, especially in respect of the discharge. The institutions will not be dealt with en bloc; voting will not be based on majorities. Instead, the assent of each individual institution will be required.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this is a quite exceptional model, and I am pleased that this point is emphasised again by this House in its resolution. It is entirely in the Commission's interests – and let me stress this point – for this exceptional nature to be underlined. The Convention is exceptional, and the solution which we have found makes it clear, above all, that it is in the interests of all three institutions to ensure that the proceedings of the Convention are a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by reiterating one key point: despite all the speculation, we have achieved a good solution very quickly, and it would be a very positive step if the signing of the Interinstitutional Agreement, together with the adoption of the resolution on the supplementary and amending budget, could take place tomorrow. In conjunction with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets, we will thus have made a significant contribution to establishing conditions for its success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
