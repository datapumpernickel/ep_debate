I should also like to thank the European Commission and Mrs Gonzalo, who gave us all of the information that we needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that the MEDA programme is the tool through which our Mediterranean policy, as formulated in the Barcelona process in 1995, is implemented. The first phase was carried out by the MEDA I programme (1995-1999) and the second by the current MEDA II programme, which was shaped by my and Mr Valdivielso's reports in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This new regulation entered into force on 15 December 2000 and we have been able to analyse how it has worked up to the end of 2002. The conclusions on MEDA I had given rise to numerous concerns, the overall payment-to-commitment ratio between 1995 and 1999 being only 26%.</p>
<p class="contents">The main causes of this relative failure were identified as the length of the negotiations, the complexity of the programme's procedures, the multi-annual nature of some projects and the limited administrative capacity of the MEDA countries, together – it has to be said – with a lack of administrative resources in the committee in charge of managing this programme, obliging it to delegate work to Technical Assistance Offices, whose involvement proved to be ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">MEDA II is not restricted to fostering the creation of a free trade area in the Mediterranean by 2010, but enhances the previous economic cooperation in the Mediterranean with a social, cultural and environmental strand. For the period from 2000 to 2006 this programme has an overall budget of EUR 12.75 billion, made up of European Union funds and loans from the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, having analysed the situation in the documents that we have tabled, we would draw the following conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we note that MEDA II represents a marked improvement on MEDA I, thanks to the creation of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office in the External Relations DG. Thus, we have moved from an overall payment-to-commitment ratio of 26% in MEDA I to 37.4% in 2000, 53% in 2001 and 92.9% in 2002, an overall ratio for MEDA II of 59%. To achieve this, the Technical Assistance Offices have been dismantled and eight delegations have been set up (in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the West Bank), with a representation only in Gaza. These delegations can take action more readily, as they have Commission representatives and clearly identified resource centres in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the comitology has been simplified. A methodological guide was published in March 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as we have recommended several times, Parliament is very mindful of the links that need to be established between the granting of aid and the respect of human rights by the various countries, and we ask for an annual report on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we want there to be regular monitoring of the observance of democratic principles when projects are chosen, not just through the bilateral negotiations between the Union and the countries concerned, but also involving civil society and NGOs in this process and ensuring that the gender criteria, in particular regarding the participation of women, are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we stress the need to further develop South-South relations and not just bilateral relations, which even today absorb more than 85% of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we take into account the work underway in the European Convention seeking to meet the five challenges for the MEDA countries: demography, employment and migration, globalisation, diminishing natural resources and the environment and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, we suggest that the sixth framework programme of research should be used for carrying out research in the fields of the environment, agriculture – with the aim of ensuring food sovereignty – and in particular water management, and suggest that more emphasis be put on renewable energies. We recall that the Mediterranean Basin has the greatest variety of agricultural specimens and seeds of all temperate areas: these must be preserved. We want more attention to be paid to agrodiversity and to implementing projects involving farmers, tradesmen, consumers and SMEs. Finally, we want all of the opportunities afforded by the information and communication society to be developed, in particular electronic communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us note that all of this work under MEDA is currently being done against the difficult background of the post-war situation in Iraq, the resolution of difficult problems in the Middle East, the peace process, in particular between Israel and Palestine, and the new balance established by the Treaty of Nice with enlargement to 25, and here we need to continue our efforts to ensure that this is not a pretext for sidelining Mediterranean cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we support the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilisations, as well as a monitoring centre for migratory flows, a Euro-Mediterranean investment bank and a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly, which would play a decisive role in formulating a properly implemented and well-integrated Euro-Mediterranean cooperation policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>.<span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Piétrasanta for the important work he has done in drafting this report, which mainly concerns the year 2000, a year of transition for the MEDA programme, as he has just pointed out himself. Generally speaking, we agree with the remarks that he has just made on the substance of the report. I will first make two comments on the political issues he has just mentioned before moving on to more operational considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the political points, and in particular the link between this type of programme and improving the situation in terms of political reform, we agree that we need to continue our efforts along the lines that he has just indicated, and that is why the Commission has just adopted a communication that seeks to give fresh impetus to the work being done in the field of human rights and democratisation in cooperation with our Mediterranean partners. Moreover, this communication also constitutes a partial response to the comments made in the Arab Human Development Report – a document that UNDP was brave enough to table last year – and proposes strengthening the political dialogue on this subject and drafting action plans on human rights and democratisation with our Mediterranean partners, the initiative as a whole being supported by the MEDA programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with a second political point that was mentioned by Mr Piétrasanta: the objective of greater participation by civil society in MEDA. We have, for instance, extended the Tempus programme to our Mediterranean partners, encouraging exchanges in the field of higher education, and we wish to support the efforts being made by non-governmental organisations to formalise the contribution of what we call civil forums to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the political issues. As far as implementation is concerned, the Commission is pleased with the progress that Mr Piétrasanta has just emphasised. The MEDA programme at issue, MEDA II, has indeed greatly benefited from the reform begun by the Commission in 2000 in the external aid sector with the aim of improving the quality of our projects, their financing and the speed with which they are implemented. Testimony to this – as Mr Piétrasanta has just said – are the efforts that have been made to devolve power and dismantle the Technical Assistance Offices, in which we are aware that this Parliament has for many years taken a keen interest. In fact the devolution process in the Mediterranean area is now almost complete, with the exception of the West Bank and Gaza, for reasons which are, alas, obvious. In any case, in Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, work to devolve power will be complete at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Another notable effect is the progress that has been made on implementing the budget, be it the utilisation rate for commitment and payment appropriations – in 2002, 100% of the available funds were used – or the payment-to-commitment ratio, which increased to 75% in 2002 compared with 25% over the period from 1995 to 1999. Finally, concerning past commitments and amounts still to be paid, they had been reduced to EUR 200 million by the end of 2001. At the end of 2002, the amount still to be paid had been reduced by a further 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly then the efforts that have been made have paid off and Parliament's support, which contributed to the Commission gaining increased administrative and human resources in this sector, has not been in vain. You have been able to see, and Mr Piétrasanta quoted similar figures to mine, that the investment you have made, that the Community taxpayer has made through you, has paid off. That is a good thing. It is a great encouragement to the Commission to continue to pursue this policy, as it is to the departments that have worked to implement it, and we do not doubt that the European Parliament will be able to see further progress when it scrutinises the results for 2001 and 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of the various points made by the AFET Committee in its opinion, two seemed to us to be particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">The first – and you have reassured us, Commissioner – was the need to ensure that the democracy clause in the association agreements is respected and the need to carry out regular and transparent checks on the impact of the MEDA programme on human rights, and this on the basis of an annual report provided by the Commission in accordance with clear criteria, a precise agenda and training in this field for European officials.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point was the importance of establishing an open and tolerant civil society in these Mediterranean countries, in particular by supporting the independence of small NGOs, and in this respect the AFET Committee regrets the fact that so few Mediterranean countries have been selected in the horizontal democracy programmes under the EIDHR and that, for example, neither Morocco nor Egypt, where civil society is active yet still fragile, will benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">This was and still is Europe’s vision of a transition towards more democracy in the countries of the Mediterranean, a transition supported by MEDA funding, by various different instruments, but also by a dialogue, in the form of a forum today and perhaps a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The report was presented in March 2003. A few days later war broke out in Iraq: it represented another vision of the democratic transition, a brutal and tragic vision that many people do not share. The Euromed dialogue is struggling to recover from this war. It will take more than a MEDA programme to get it back on track. Let us hope that the adoption of the Middle East roadmap by the Quartet will be the first step towards doing so and a genuine sign of hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Piétrasanta’s report on the MEDA programme is widely supported and a joint effort: we really do have the same aims. The two political points on which you based your speech are, firstly, the importance of the role of the Mediterranean as a European border and also as an area which is the focus of a substantial chunk of our Union’s foreign policy, and, secondly, the fact that the Commission certainly made its measures very tangible and more timely in the transition from MEDA I to MEDA II. Indeed, in our meetings with the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, we have been constantly reminded of the need for different administration timetables. In this connection, we note that the Commission is making a considerable effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not, of course, list the points already mentioned by the rapporteur. I would like to focus on a number of political requirements which go hand in hand with the action programme. We certainly need to identify new social action programmes and, above all, we need to concentrate on protecting people with disabilities as well as new forms of cooperation concerning the protection of children. In the context of the situations on which you, Commissioner, are focusing, we would point out the need, with a view precisely to foreign policy and the role of the European Union, to insist on the conclusion of the Syria/EU negotiations in order to complete the network of Euro-Mediterranean association agreements, just as we must proceed as soon as possible with the selection of the funding programme planning projects which is at present suspended in Israel and Palestine, for they could play a very important role in this part of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by stressing the need for a parliamentary assembly, for that is the political forum in which a solution could well be found to many of the processes currently in progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take the opportunity to underline the excellent cooperation that we have enjoyed in the drafting of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The tense international situation provides further evidence every day that the economies and societies in the Mediterranean Basin need to evolve to become more prosperous, more socially cohesive and more democratic. This is in fact the only way, we are convinced, that we can work effectively to increase the stability of these regions and combat terrorism in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The twofold reform that has taken place, that of MEDA – now MEDA II – and the structural reform of external aid management, has been the source of many new and very promising initiatives, including the creation of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office. Similarly, we have high expectations of the various strategic documents, multi-annual programming exercises and new shortened and simplified procedures. Nevertheless, we would stress the importance of assessing how the resources allocated to the programmes are managed, something which should be guided by a principle that is simple and yet, it would seem, so difficult: the amounts budgeted should actually be spent and spent well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona process is also a project to create a vast free trade area. The new situation gives rise to new questions. Will the momentum behind the European Union's Mediterranean policy survive enlargement? What is happening about South-South cooperation or interregional cooperation?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should not forget that it is in our interests for the funds to be distributed in such a way that they target in particular priority areas, such as social cohesion, the development of democracy, human rights, support for civil society, the specific situation of women, culture, youth and sustainable development. Over the next few years we will therefore continue to assess progress along these lines under the Commission's attentive gaze. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this regard, for example, I believe that for the first time we have distinguished terrorism as such, as an act that is distinct from government responses – which should also be condemned. Terrorism has been identified as a phenomenon that should be condemned in its own right and eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very interesting that the road map and other measures to support Iraqi integrity have been raised. However, I would like to say, and in this I agree with Mr Piétrasanta, that our Mediterranean policy has a number of black holes or black spots and is essentially unbalanced. I feel we need to make an effort to render it more coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, like Mr Piétrasanta, I feel there has been very little investment in capacity building and the structure of certain administrative bodies that could achieve democracy. Given the structure of the countries, and of many of their economic administration services, amongst others, it is very difficult, because democracy does not consist of holding elections, but of building an entire system, which needs to be far more visible and systematic. Furthermore, we need to help the Mediterranean countries with which we are going to cooperate, and which receive a great deal of aid, to understand that the aid must go hand in hand with a deep sense of responsibility, within game rules that do not allow maximum, but minimum tolerance. I am referring, for example, to the administration of the funds received, just as other funds might often also be misused or used to finance oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we need to show that democracy means a consolidated, transparent State. Without this there can be no democracy, let us not delude ourselves. I would say the same for the Assembly we are trying to create. We must be demanding and set democratic conditions that must be fulfilled. Otherwise we will only achieve unbalanced representation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
