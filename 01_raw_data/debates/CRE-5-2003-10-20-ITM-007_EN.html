This proposal is part of the Community's on-going efforts to reduce emissions to improve air quality in order to protect the environment and the health of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this proposal is to tighten emission standards for engines in non-road applications in the light of technological developments and the sector's contribution to emissions to air. The proposal also aims to extend the scope of the current Directive 97/68 to include engines in inland waterway vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions from conventional on-road transport continue to be reduced; it is therefore right that, in parallel, further progress is made in the non-road sector, as technically and economically feasible solutions become available.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission is conscious of the global nature of the market for engines covered by this directive and is aware of the benefits to industry of aligning developments with parallel regulatory proposals in the United States. I am very pleased with the progress that has been made on this proposal and applaud the important role that Parliament has played in moving towards an agreement at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, then, is this about? This is about the exhaust emissions from construction machinery, excavators, locomotives and inland waterway vessels, and I believe that it is clear to many members of the public that we have to do something about them. On a building site on a street in a European city, the position is that the excavator and the bulldozer are allowed to disgorge far more emission into the atmosphere than the lorry that takes away the rubble, even though they are equipped with the same engine. It simply defies explanation that the same engine, at the same location, but installed in two different machines, is allowed to produce different levels of emissions. It is clear, then, that we have to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very glad that it has been possible, even before first reading, to negotiate with the Council a compromise that was brought in jointly by the major political groups and with the support of many Members, with the ultimate objective of avoiding a conciliation procedure. This compromise goes some way towards what we decided in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We want to reduce the emissions from machines that are not road-going, and to do so in several stages. In so doing, we are in fact going down the same road as the United States, whose Environmental Protection Agency, as recently as April this year, submitted a proposal dealing with what is also our main concern – nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions – and indicating courses of action similar to the ones that we have discussed. This leads me to believe that this is the right way to go, as these machines are marketed around the world: several stages to reduce nitrogen oxides and particulates, with the result that, at the final stage, the incorporation of a particulate filter is an invariable requirement, enabling the substantial risk to health to be contained and the public, especially in urban agglomerations to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also including railway locomotives in this directive. Some of you may well have seen, when standing on a station, the quantity of particulates that a diesel shunting engine discharges into the atmosphere as it goes back and forth. This, I believe, is another area where we need to act, but we are proceeding more cautiously than with the other machines, in that we have incorporated a review process in order to ensure that technological solutions remain feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to inland waterway vessels. I think this is an area in which we could have gone rather further, but there was no great momentum to do so – not because of technical considerations, but because of political considerations at Council level. We agreed to take care to ensure that engines cannot be electronically adjusted. We have seen how, as a result of electronic manipulation, the emission performance of some models of lorries in the United States was quite different under actual operating conditions to what it had been in the test cycle for type-approval. That possibility, too, will be excluded. We have agreed that performance once the test cycle is completed must not result in vastly greater emissions into the atmosphere, but that close attention must be paid to ensure that it remains within reasonable bounds in relation to the test cycle. I see us, today, as being able to take a significant step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also ensured that manufacturers who complete the stages early can use that as a selling point. I believe that, ultimately, customers will see that as a crucial factor in their decision to buy, so that they can say, ‘here are engines that adhere to emission standards that are not yet in force – that could be the machine for me’, and bringing them onto the market at an early stage could represent a sales opportunity for the manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, then, this is the right step to take and in the right direction. With it, we are following in the tradition of the many and varied pieces of legislation that we have adopted on cars, lorries, motorcycles, chain saws and lawnmowers. I believe that it can truly be said that we are writing another chapter in the success story of ‘Clean Air for Europe’. I thank all those who have helped in this.</p>

We in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, not being environmental scientists, have only examined the rationale underlying this report. Of key importance is, of course, the principle that the same standards must apply on and off the roads. With regard to non-road mobile machinery, we must draw our conclusions from experience gathered from cleaning engines in lorries. This report clearly indicates how the methods used can also be applied to other polluting engines in road machinery other than trucks.</p>
<p class="contents">The share of emissions of non-mobile machinery has increased relatively speaking, precisely because of the success of engine cleaning techniques used in lorries. This is, in my view, an additional argument in favour of this adaptation. In a broader sense, though, this is also about the reputation of water and rail transport, of which it has always been claimed that they are cleaner than road transport. If that is the case, progress should also be made here, and cleaner diesel engines must be provided. The technology exists and is becoming available, and this is why the sector is given time to adjust. This must be done in such a way as to ensure that an incentive is given to the sector to accelerate the replacement process with diesel engines that are cleaner and that meet the prescribed conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, harmonisation must also be examined at global level. This is about one market of a certain type of machinery, and that too has been given due consideration in the report. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism supports the purport of the rapporteur's proposals and we are, in principle, in favour of including in this report environmental standards for diesel machinery, that is to say diesel engines used in rail transport with a capacity in excess of 560 KW. In this respect, the rule that applies elsewhere should also apply here, namely that the sector is given a reasonable amount of time, coupled to technological development, to carry out the necessary innovations. In short, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I can say that Mr Lange's proposals are a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has certainly gained a reputation in committee for having an extremely good technical understanding of the subject matters involved. Even if I do not necessarily agree with all the conclusions he reaches, I pay tribute to all the work he has done and for his understanding of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I opposed many of the amendments that Mr Lange first proposed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but I am happy to say that since then he has put in an enormous amount of work to negotiate compromises with the Council, the vast majority of which I am happy to endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">I always believe that the approach we should take on environmental emissions directives must be proportionate. We must ensure that the environmental benefits are always balanced against the cost. So often in the EU we impose enormous costs on business and industry for sometimes relatively marginal improvements in environmental performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the compromises that have been negotiated I am happy now to support. The text is much more closely aligned with US EPO-proposed tier 4 limits and dates. The document now states that the proposed package of limit values should be aligned, as far as possible, with developments in the United States so as to offer manufacturers a global market for their engine concepts. That is an approach I strongly support. The text now puts back the review date to 2007, which gives much more opportunity for practical experience with after-treatment technology to be achieved before stages IIIB and IV are confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I will not support Amendments Nos 71, 75, 82 and 89, concerning replacement engines, the classification of auxiliary engines and engines used to perform maintenance or construction work. Because specific rail technology has not yet, in my view, been satisfactorily developed to meet the requirements of stages 3 and 4, I believe it is not possible to establish if and when these requirements can be met.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy with the vast majority of the compromises that Mr Lange has so skilfully negotiated and wish to pay tribute to the work he has done in that respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With one or two reservations, I think Mr Callanan will also be able to put his hand up for most things, so I think that we have a very good result.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important step forward in controlling emissions in a sector not really yet touched. A whole range of non-road mobile machinery – construction equipment, barges and all sorts of niche equipment we have not yet though about – is going to be brought sensibly under control, putting an end to a lot of smelly diesel fume emissions in all sorts of strange places that prompt complaints. Sensible arrangements have been made for seasonal agricultural equipment and special equipment such as the diesel engines used to launch lifeboats in the UK, all of which have limited hours of operation every year.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, quite frankly, that the ambitions of Parliament, as expressed by the Committee on the Environment, have exceeded the wishes of the Commission and the Council, particularly with regard to diesel engine trains. This is an area that we need to revisit at a future time and examine the particular circumstances that exist in the new Member States when they enter the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are now reaching a point where we can thoroughly support, by a large majority, the outcome of the rapporteur's work. I congratulate him on his efforts and hope that we will make future progress on the outstanding matters within an appropriate timescale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Five years ago, you needed three readings to achieve a sound result in the car oil programme. Now, and I am thereby briefly looking at Mr Bowe, agreement has been reached with the Council after first reading. That is first-rate!</p>
<p class="contents">Air pollution in the traditional sense of the word will soon be a thing of the past in Europe, at least once we have introduced the new engines in cars, lorries, in ordinary engines, chain saws and now also in pile drivers, freight trains and inland waterway vessels. The Commission did not want to introduce legislation, particularly for those trains and inland waterway vessels, until much later on. Parliament and the Council, though, refused to be thrown off balance and regulated this straight away, because it is technically possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Freight trains and inland waterway vessels use much less energy, simply because resistance is much less significant. This means that the environmental benefit from freight trains and inland waterway vessels is completely back to what it used to be, something with which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are delighted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have laid down rules for cars, motorbikes, ships, and motor-driven saws, and now it is the turn of non-road vehicles. This House is characterised by its continuity, in that you do not have to agree with every word, but every time, we have the same problem. The industry that builds the machine says, ‘We’ll sort it out’. Those who use the machines will of course say, ‘Oh God, we will need to use this for a long time before we can write the investment off.’ All this is understandable, and so I believe that the compromise at which we have arrived is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in particular the fact that we are in step with the Americans that means we are on the right track when it comes to doing our bit to reduce distortions in competition. I am quite convinced that the reduction of emission values is more expensive in an area as industrialised as Europe than it is in other countries. Our problem is a simple one; there are more and more machines. They may be getting cleaner, but machines as a whole are becoming more numerous, and so we cannot take as rosy a view of our pollution of the environment with exhaust gases as we might wish. Although I am glad that we have found a way to accommodate the railways to some extent, a degree of harshness is still apparent, so there are two or three amendments with which I am not quite so happy. It is quite clear, though, that if people want, in the long term, to run these large motors – which are not 80 horse-power jobs, but check in at between 600 and 1000 kW, and have a correspondingly massive output – then they will have to put their hands in their pockets to do so; they must realise that they will have to do that in future, and they must make preparations. I believe that we are on the right track. If one thing or another remains to be sorted out, then our injured rapporteur will be able to handle that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have, in the past, been very thorough in campaigning for a reduction in the emission of pollutants from motors, and now we want to deal with stationary apparatus and mobile machines, an area that has not hitherto been covered.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating these pollutants, or actually reducing them, has no profound influence on potential pollution overall, but it is significant, in that these machines and pieces of apparatus are highly localised and are generally in use for a considerable period of time. This results in heavy local pollution, which is detrimental – particularly through particulates and nitrogen oxides – to people’s health. This is something we should constantly bear in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell Mr Lange that we should be rather more cautious here, and that this is where we should not allow ourselves to be misled into presenting specific technical solutions as especially effective in reducing the emission of pollutants. Not only do we have to cut pollutants, but we also have to think about reducing CO2 in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. We know that installing filters increases the output of CO2. This, surely, is where a compromise has to be found, so that, while calling for a reduction, we nonetheless have to keep asking ourselves to what extent we have to approach this problem only from this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I can agree with the specification that the rapporteur has proposed, and we should continue to take this robust line. I can remember how, in 1998, it was prophesied that Europe’s oil sector would collapse; yet it ended up being quicker off the mark than the timescale we had proposed. Our approach is without doubt the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">I am rather more cautious about extending this to railways and boats, where I am sure that there are still some open questions. We are attempting to move more goods on to rails and boats. We also know that public transport also has to be covered – a sector that makes particular use of rail vehicles. These, though, produce pollutants, and it is on these that we want to impose rules. We will have to re-examine this. That is why the proposal is right to include such vehicles; had it not done so, approving it would have been a bit more difficult. This way, we can agree on a common denominator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It recognises the benefits to industry of regulatory alignment with parallel developments in the USA, and at the same time it is compatible with industry's capacity to respond. It also provides for a marked improvement in the environmental performance of engines in non-road applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Importantly, it also includes a provision for a review in 2007 whereby the Commission will assess whether there is any need for adjustment to the Stage IIIb and Stage IV emissions standards and the timetable for their application or exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the proposed compromise addresses the issue of labelling and a number of technical issues such as 'cycle beating' and test cycle improvements. It also recognises that some details cannot be finalised at this point and are best left to comitology or the review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased with the outcome and again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for his efforts to reach an agreement at first reading. The Commission can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
