The first of these drafts – headed No 130 – looks to the creation of a committee of senior police officers at a senior level within the framework of Article K3 of the Treaty of European Union. While such a committee is undoubtedly necessary, since there has been virtually no forum until now where such persons can meet, it does not really achieve the objective of real cooperation in the field of law enforcement at operational level. Consequently, my main amendments to this draft wish to see the creation of a multi‐disciplinary group which comprises heads of police, customs and other law enforcement agencies, for example top civil servants in interior ministries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we think it is important that Europol should be given a more specific role. The text implies a half‐hearted involvement of this body. Consequently, my amendments beef up the role of Europol by calling for its involvement in discussions, planning and implementation measures. Thirdly, after consultation with, amongst others, the German presidency and the British Home Office, I have been more specific about some of the tasks which this new committee should carry out. These include establishing mixed inspection operations at the external borders and the setting up of an effective information exchange and early warning system.</p>
<p class="contents">The second of these two drafts – No 129 – wishes to see the deployment of large numbers of police on recognised routes. In this case we have included the vital element of intelligence and changed the text to read ‘if necessary the deployment of large numbers". Here I just want to say that it really is important that we make use of intelligence resources and not simply put larger numbers of police and customs on the biggest routes. Large criminal organisations are sufficiently intelligent themselves to know where the police have their resources. Therefore, we have to counter that by improving our own intelligence resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we do not like the words ‘to ensure maximum possible police success, especially in the form of arrests". We have substituted the words ‘tracking down criminals and their organisations and bringing them to justice". Police and customs success should not be measured just by arrests but by success in bringing criminal organisations to justice. It is my hope that the Council, the Commission and ourselves will be able to get together to make certain that these modifications take place in what are two thoroughly worthwhile initiatives which this Parliament has been able to improve upon.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schmid </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the proposals before the House on closer police cooperation in Europe are good ones. That applies, firstly, to the idea that when the Council group on police cooperation meets, those who actually do the work must also be involved, namely the police officers. Secondly, I agree with the proposal that the police should carry out operations on recognised routes. This approach has already been tested successfully in the cooperation between the Schengen states. It works. The experience that has been collected – I have spoken to a police officer who is organising something of the kind – justifies introducing this as an instrument of police cooperation in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Sir Jack has tabled amendments that we welcome. We also do so because we know these proposals are based on talks with experts.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we endorse all his proposals concerning the joint action on police cooperation and agree with him that it should cover not just the police but also those working in customs and other relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have a problem with the German translation. The phrase ‘law enforcement agency", whose meaning is clear in English, has been translated into German as ‘<span class="italic">Vollstreckungsteam</span> " and ‘<span class="italic">Vollstreckungseinrichtung</span> ". They mean something quite different in German. In German, <span class="italic">Vollstreckung</span> relates to the execution of death sentences or orders to pay. It means something quite different. So we have tabled an amendment to rectify this.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear we have a similar problem with Sir Jack"s proposal about operations on routes. The English phrase is ‘the best and most sophisticated intelligence". All I can say is that he is right. This was translated into German as ‘<span class="italic">die besten nachrichtendienstlichen Instrumente</span> ". In German that means including the secret services. There are Member States, including mine, in which the secret service is strictly separate from the police. So we emphasise that the English version is the authoritative one. Then we can endorse the proposals.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mendes Bota </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Sir Jack Stewart‐Clark's report is short, to the point and effective. If only the authorities entrusted with enforcing the law in a spirit of liberty, security and justice could be as swift, direct and effective in fighting both organised and spontaneous crime, which unfortunately are constantly on the increase. Nevertheless, cooperation between the police and customs authorities has become a key factor in the success of this fight. We therefore support the rapporteur's recommendation that a European‐level multi‐disciplinary group should be set up, with the power to make decisions on improving exchanges of information and on harmonising technical communications systems between the various national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that investigations at the external borders of the EU are effective and to investigate the main routes used for illegal activities. It is therefore essential to beef up Europol's role, and that is the aim of the amendments we have proposed. Although Europol has only really existed since October last year, following the protracted process of ratifying the 1995 Europol Convention, the Treaty of Amsterdam gives it a specific role. It is not a European police force, but an instrument which the police authorities of the Member States must not fail to exploit to the full. This process of police cooperation has proved its worth through the intergovernmental Schengen agreement, which has acted as a genuine test‐bed. This success obviously owes a great deal to the possibility of deploying large numbers of police officers when necessary, as recommended in the Enfopol no 129 draft, but as the rapporteur has quite rightly said, the success of these cooperative actions on crime should be measured in qualitative terms and not just by the number of arrests made.</p>

I could not resist the temptation to jump in myself and give my opinion on Sir Jack Stewart‐Clark's report, as what shines through this report is the special attitude of someone who wants not just a police force, but a top‐rate force. In fact, the class of crime itself has risen over the years. Crimes are no longer committed by men with gold teeth or with only one hand. They are committed by the sort of people we invite to dinner, who have the same education as us, who went to the same universities, and even by people from excellent families. Crime has nowadays become more refined, so I believe that the multi‐disciplinary force proposed in the report is an extremely commendable idea. The people who devise crimes have now become so sophisticated that we really need criminal science to beat them. So it is not just a question of cops and robbers any more, crime has taken on an extra dimension because of the globalisation that has changed the world we live in.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome Sir Jack Stewart‐Clark's proposals, as I think that they are in line with what we need to create a sophisticated, multi‐disciplinary Europol, with high‐calibre people, graduates and so forth.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sjöstedt </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, cooperation between the police forces in the different countries, as well as between police and customs, is a welcome development in combating crime. Much of Europol's work also contributes towards achieving the same end. On the other hand, it is important to ensure that police cooperation stops short of effectively placing national police forces under EU command or making them subject to supranational decisions. In the long run, as Europol continues to develop, there is also a risk of duplicating the work of Interpol. It is essential that Europol should complement Interpol, rather than replace it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on one particular point in the report, namely Amendment No 11 on the transmission of personal data. The amendment is commendable in every way and highlights the importance of adhering to the relevant Council of Europe convention. However, I am doubtful as to whether it goes far enough. In my view, Europol currently has a number of serious shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 10(1) of the Europol Convention and its implementing provisions allow considerable scope for compiling records on persons convicted or suspected of having committed a crime. It is possible to record a great deal of sensitive personal data. I therefore believe that it is essential to exert tighter control and that there should be an effective supervisory body when the register comes into operation, so as to avoid similar problems to those experienced with the SIS register under the Schengen Agreement. In practice, the register should be more strictly controlled and better supervised. It is already having a detrimental effect both in terms of integration and combating crime. In my view, it should be a basic requirement that registration applies only to those people who have been convicted or are suspected of having committed a crime.</p>

I therefore believe that this amendment should not be included.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second text which concerns fuller monitoring of the routes used by criminals, I am astonished to see just how politically correct and unoriginal the amendments proposed by the rapporteur are. Amendment No 1 in the French version deletes illegal immigration and Amendment No 4 omits the expression ‘police authorities". You are living in cloud‐cuckoo‐land if you think that by deleting these words you can eliminate what is happening in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore act rationally and reject amendments that spring from a superstitious fear of the aspects of reality which are perhaps distasteful to the rapporteur. Illegal immigration is a real problem. Police authorities are a necessity in any civilised society. I would also add that frank words are a step forward, not a step back.</p>

Without a common approach and shared resources the various early warning systems in place to prevent criminal activity will never function satisfactorily. Europol must be granted significant powers and a clear role in both the coordination of checks taking place on the Union"s external border and in the development of the information exchange and early warning systems used by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that, with the aid of Europol, we should be able to establish permanent cooperation in police and customs matters between officials in the Central and Eastern European countries that have applied for EU membership and those in the Union. One of the greatest concerns and hopes of the citizens of the EU, with regard to the enlargement of the Union, is that the single market should be kept secure with more being done to make the task of combatting international crime more effective. For this reason, one of the strategies prior to membership should be to focus to a greater degree than is currently the case on training the police and customs authorities in the former Communist bloc. Applicant countries must forge lasting links with cooperation agencies that operate under the auspices of Europol, such as police and customs officers" work groups, well in advance of EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The extraordinary summit meeting scheduled to take place in Tampere during the Finnish Presidency will be devoted to the internal security of the Union, including action to combat drug trafficking, which is rife in the single market. At Tampere there must also be broader debate on the future challenges facing police cooperation in the Union, with special focus on the problems stemming from the enlargement process.</p>

The presidency intends to strengthen European cooperation and coordination in order to combat organised crime, an aim which the Commission wholeheartedly supports. For a long time now, we have been aware of the need to improve both the system for exchanging information and the cooperation in passing on intelligence about criminals within the Union. Schengen cooperation has already set us on the right road, and now it is up to the Union to exploit its achievements fully. In our view, there is also a need for clearer guidelines for carrying out joint operations, as well as for education and training activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also note with satisfaction that Europol has been given an important role in both joint actions, particularly in relation to the development of strategies to uncover the routes used by smugglers. We regard this as a very constructive step. The Commission and the Member States will consider together the most effective ways of implementing the two joint actions. In particular, I am considering the possibilities for allocating project support through the Oisin and Falcone programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is able to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. In our view, they help to make the significance of both instruments substantially clearer.</p>
