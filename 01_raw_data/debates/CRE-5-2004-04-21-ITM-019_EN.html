It is also my last report in this House, because after ten years, I am retiring.</p>
<p class="contents">Not so long ago, the importance of the Lisbon process was discussed once again during the Summit in Brussels. If we want to turn Europe into the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society by 2010, there is of course a great deal left to be done. As we have already witnessed in the case of <span class="italic">e-</span>Europe 2005, a successful implementation of access to broadband largely relies on the availability of <span class="italic">e-</span>Content. Indeed, it is possible to have broadband, but if there is nothing on it, then the public will not exactly be enthusiastic. The same applies to advanced services for users of mobile telephony, and I would, for example, refer to the third generation.</p>
<p class="contents">I spent a few weeks in China recently, and it struck me that the Chinese, together with the Japanese and the South Koreans, are already getting excited about fourth-generation mobile telephony. What this means, then, is that, in terms of third-generation mobile telephony too, Europe will be lagging ever further behind, as the figures at Nokia testify. In this light, the report on <span class="italic">e-</span>Content is extremely important, because it promotes an increase in productivity and innovation, better information products and services; it has a positive impact on <span class="italic">e-</span>Government, another area in which we are trailing behind badly, and it leads to more projects in the areas of <span class="italic">e-</span>Health, <span class="italic">e-</span>Business and <span class="italic">e-</span>Learning.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased that the Commissioner is here this evening. The Commission's present <span class="italic">E-</span>Content <span class="italic">+</span>-proposal identifies the obstacles, particularly in the areas of public interest in Europe,<span class="italic"> </span>and also the areas in which the market is overlooking adequate investments. The market cannot do everything and the governments have a just role. In the current proposal, conditions are being created for better access to, and better use of, digital content and, where necessary, for greater economic return for services based on access to, and re-use of, digital content.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has tabled 16 amendments to the Commission's proposal. By means of these, we want to ensure that the report targets the public sector, that consideration is given to the financial perspectives after 2007, that a budget to the tune of EUR 55 million will be set aside for the years 2005 and 2006, and that the total budget will amount to EUR 163 million. In this connection, I should like to take the opportunity of thanking my shadow-rapporteurs, Mrs Gil and Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, for the excellent working relationship we have had.</p>
<p class="contents">It promised to be a good celebration, because the Council, with whom we negotiated, also benefited from completing in one reading, so that we would not face any delays. Our basic budget was EUR 163 million. The Council, and the Irish Presidency in particular, led us to believe that a deal was within reach if we were to reduce the amount to EUR 145 million. As befits good parliamentarians, we ultimately hoped for an amount in the region of 150 million, but, during the informal trialogue, the Irish Presidency responded that the budget should not exceed 120 million and added that, if we were to push a little, we could probably end up with 138 million. We indicated that this was insufficient for us and that 140 million was the absolute minimum. We subsequently asked the Council Presidency to declare in writing that an agreement was reached on 140 million. The deal expired at 1.30 p.m. this afternoon. It is characteristic of the Council that I received the following message at 5.11 p.m. I will quote it verbatim, as this will look good in the historical records. <span class="italic">'However, you ask for a written position from the Council in favour of a financial amount of one hundred and forty million euros. On the basis of the COREPER discussion this morning, this is not possible as there remains a clear blocking minority at one hundred thirty million euros. However, my own estimation, and that is as the Chairman of COREPER I and based on the contacts with a number of key delegations at and around the meeting, is that if the European Parliament were, via its vote tomorrow, to take a position for a higher amount than one hundred thirty million, it may very likely prove possible ultimately to gather a sufficient majority in the Council for that'.</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is now the third time that we have received the same message from the Council, and each time we ask them to deliver, they respond that they are unable to do so. With this amount of, what I would call, uncertainty in the Council, we cannot but conclude that we are about to launch an election campaign. That we will be telling the citizens that the Council makes fine promises in Brussels where the Lisbon process in concerned, but as soon as it has to deliver, also in terms of financial means in order to achieve the Lisbon process, the Council fails to come up with the goods and leaves us empty-handed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely regrettable that we, who want to have the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010, and we in this House, are being treated by the Council in this manner. I am glad that election campaigns are on the way. They will in any event spur me on to take part and to denounce the Council's ambivalence. The future is bright. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I turn now to the e-content+ programme. The Commission aims to launch this programme, as the rapporteur explained, at the beginning of 2005, nearly halfway to the target year for the Lisbon Agenda: 2010. We need to improve conditions for innovation by business - notably in certain sectors of the digital content market - and that is why this programme is very relevant to the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The online digital content market offers significant potential for growth, but it also provides an ideal platform for innovative digital content products and services that transcend national boundaries. Imagine, for example, if our public administrations in Europe all collected and stored data and information in the same way and if, on top of that, our citizens were proficient in all the languages of the Union. I tried to raise awareness of that with the European Year of Languages, and the process is ongoing: people are learning more and more languages, but we still have a long way to go to reach our goal. However, on the Internet we are likely to see many more maps of trans-European highways, waterways and other natural and man-made features, and then we will see large European digital libraries of cultural and scholarly repute. We will see much more European digital learning material.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that in May 2004 the European Union will encompass 25 Member States, 20 languages, even more cultures, a great many regions and a truly fragmented market for any business intending to develop innovative cross-border digital content products and services. This is a situation that should be taken into account when the e-content programme starts in January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The outlook might not be as bleak as it appears. The recently adopted directive on public sector information aligns legal frameworks in Member States with respect to the re-use of information held by the public sector. The difficulties in combining formats and languages can be addressed using today's information technologies, subject to the eContent+ proposal. That is why – and I agree completely with the rapporteur – it is so important that this e-content programme should be seen in conjunction with the e-learning programme, since people first have to be taught to utilise the content before it can be of real benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed programme recommends focusing on clearly fragmented parts of the digital content market in Europe where market forces alone have been insufficient to drive growth, as rightly stated by the rapporteur. It targets three domains: spatial or geographical data, educational material, and cultural content.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore pleased to note that the amendments to its proposal tabled by the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, improve the proposal. We would like to thank him and the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, for their efforts to find a compromise with the Council in an attempt to conclude proceedings at first reading. Even if the rapporteur has problems with the Council, he should have none with the Commission because it can accept all the amendments tabled by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was rapporteur for the first e-content report and I can see that Mr van Velzen has worked very hard to try to ensure we give Europe an advantage in e-content. As he stated earlier, the US has the world's most advanced digital economy and Europe, with its fragmented markets and smaller media and telecommunication companies, is trying to catch up in terms of quality of content and products.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than talk about what is in his report, which has been eloquently summarised both by the rapporteur and the Commission, I want to talk about the Council. I am extremely concerned about the sort of attitude and approach that the Council has adopted. It has stated time and again that it wants to achieve the Lisbon objectives, key among which is the opening-up of opportunities for Europe in the electronic age. However, when it comes to the Council putting its money where its mouth is, nothing at all happens.</p>
<p class="contents">As the reporter said, the Council has treated Parliament with complete contempt. We have been haggling over figures – 20 million, 30 million, 50 million – because it is unwilling to provide sufficient resources to make this programme happen. In a Europe of 25 Member States, adequate resources will be needed if we are to gain a competitive edge over our major competitor, the US, in this area. Many high-skill jobs rely on us being able to get our content right and on having this programme and reaching SMEs and other providers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great pity that owing to the Council's attitude we have been unable to finalise this initiative. It was key for this legislature to do that and have this programme up and running for 2005, and there was real will on Parliament's part to make this happen. It is to the detriment of the EU that it has not, and this has been because the Council has been unwilling to pay for it. What it is offering at the moment is peanuts in terms of a Union of 25.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who did his utmost to achieve closure, because some of us in other Groups wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal, which was for EUR 165 million. That is the amount needed if we are genuinely to deliver on this eContent proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This failure is not due to a lack of effort on the rapporteur's part. I hope that at second reading the Council will get the message that Parliament is not willing to support programmes that are simply piecemeal efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
