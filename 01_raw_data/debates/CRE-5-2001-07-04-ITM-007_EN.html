<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Nelly Maes (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0516_EN.html">H-0516/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">The December 2000 Nice European Council approved a Declaration on the future of the Union. The declaration calls for a wide-ranging and searching debate on the European Union’s future. Not only the Member States but also states applying for accession, national parliaments, the European Parliament and the general public are all to be involved in that debate. The European Council has thus improperly and in absolute disregard for the subsidiarity principle, bypassed the democratic legitimacy of the constitutionally established regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Louis Michel recently repeated his intention to allow MEPs to sit also as members of the Belgian Parliament. We welcome what Mr Michel has to say about the closer involvement of members of parliaments, provided that he also includes the elected representatives of communes and regions. Will the Council, in deference to the subsidiarity principle, include the constitutionally established regions in the plans it is drawing up for Europe’s future?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 2 by Pere Esteve (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0518_EN.html">H-0518/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">In view of the increasingly important and prominent involvement of the sub-state levels in the various EU decision-making procedures, the broad debate on the future of the Union which is taking shape mainly around the Laeken Summit should also provide answers to institutional issues relating to the involvement, from the legislative and judicial points of view, of constitutional regions (sub-state entities with their own legislative powers guaranteed under the Constitution of the State to which they belong) in the development, implementation, monitoring and assessment of EU policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council therefore intending to amend the Treaties (Part Five, Section 4) in such a way as to grant these regions the right to appeal direct to the Court of Justice when their prerogatives are under threat, as the Member States are able to do?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 3 by Gorka Knörr Borrás (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0520_EN.html">H-0520/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is expected that during the Belgian presidency the Laeken Declaration on the future of the EU will be adopted. A number of Member States, including Germany, Austria, Belgium and the UK, have established mechanisms for the participation of their regional or federal bodies in Council proceedings. Given that the autonomous regions of the Spanish state, the German and Austrian Länder and the Belgian regions possess significant powers of their own which are in many cases affected by Community decisions, does the Council support the view that the regions could be directly represented within itself?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 4 by Bart Staes (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0522_EN.html">H-0522/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">With the declaration to be made at Laeken on Saturday, 15 December, the federal state of Belgium intends to make its contribution to the debate on the future of the European Union. In that respect, the positive stance adopted by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt on the joint political declaration by seven constitutional regions is particularly pleasing. At the end of May, he received the regional president of Catalonia, the minister-president of Salzburg, the first minister of Scotland, the chief ministers of Flanders and Wallonia and the ministers for European/federal affairs of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia, who are pressing for the role of constitutionally recognised regions in the European Union to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council support greater Treaty-based involvement for constitutional regions in the European project in view of the added democratic legitimacy they bring to the construction of the European Union? If not, why is it opposed to the greater Treaty-based involvement of constitutional regions in mapping out the future of Europe?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 5 by Neil MacCormick (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0524_EN.html">H-0524/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU. The IGC also recognised the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its Institutions. This formula opens the possibility of a form of convention with representatives of national parliaments, the European Parliament and the governments of the Member States. Contrary to the principle of subsidiarity no reference was made to the constitutional regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council – following the democratic principle of subsidiarity – involve all the parliaments of the constitutional regions when it chooses a form of convention?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 6 by Jillian Evans (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0525_EN.html">H-0525/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to the Declaration in Annex IV of the Nice Treaty the debate about the future development of the EU should address, inter alia, the following question: How to establish and monitor a more precise delimitation of competences between the EU and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity? The present idea of subsidiarity in the EC Treaty is commonly interpreted as regulating only relations between Union and states. This interpretation has to be broadened as outlined in the resolution of the European Parliament of 26 October 2000 on better lawmaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Laeken Declaration propose to amend the Treaties so that they specifically include recognition of, and respect for, the political and legislative powers of the Member States’ internal political units in their executive, legislative and judicial relations with the EU Institutions?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 7 by Eurig Wyn (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0526_EN.html">H-0526/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU. It also recognises the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its Institutions. In December 2001 the Belgian presidency will be concluded by a contribution to this debate, the Laeken Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Laeken Declaration recognise that a further democratisation of the European decision-making process calls for a more radical reform, with legislative power vested in two chambers, the European Parliament and a reformed Council that would subsume some aspects of the present Committee of the Regions and would strongly enhance the role of the constitutional regions?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 8 by Carlos Bautista Ojeda (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0560_EN.html">H-0560/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Laeken Declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration that calls for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU. Following a report to its Gothenburg meeting in June 2001, the European Council at its meeting in Laeken in December 2001 will agree on appropriate initiatives for the continuation of this process. According to the Declaration the process should address, inter alia, the following question: How to establish and monitor a more precise delimitation of competences between the EU and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council – following the principle of subsidiarity – refrain from infringing the competences of the constitutional regions? How will the Council establish and monitor this respect for the competences of the constitutional regions?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 9 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0531_EN.html">H-0531/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Declaration No 54 attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam on subsidiarity</span></p>
<p class="contents">Declaration No 54 attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam, on subsidiarity, states: –It is taken for granted by the German, Austrian and Belgian governments that action by the European Community in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity not only concerns the Member States but also their entities to the extent that they have their own law-making powers conferred on them under national constitutional law.’ Similarly, Declaration No 23 attached to the Treaty of Nice, on the future of the Union, states in its third paragraph: ‘In 2001, the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, in cooperation with the Commission and involving the European Parliament, will encourage wide-ranging discussions with all interested parties’; and, in its fourth paragraph: ‘the European Council, at its meeting in Laeken in December 2001, will agree on a declaration containing appropriate initiatives for the continuation of this process’.</p>
<p class="contents">What approach will the Belgian presidency take to Declaration No 54 attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam, on the principle of subsidiarity and the entities having exclusive powers? What does the Belgian presidency believe to be the best means of resolving potential conflicts arising from decisions of the EU institutions where such decisions clash with the exclusive powers of those entities? Would the correct solution not be for the European Court of Justice to be given the power to rule on any appeals lodged by those constitutional entities and for the Treaties to legitimate the power of those entities to defend their interests in court at Union level?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The report by the presidency, submitted to the European Council in Gothenburg, describes the vast range of initiatives which have already been launched in Member States and candidate countries, and also by the institutions of the Union. This report notes the numerous initiatives that have been taken in various Member States, involving different regional bodies. It also lists the events organised as part of this debate by the Committee of the Regions. The various questions raised, which are all on the subject of the role of the regional bodies in the process of preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, are concerned with two types of problem. On the one hand, there are the detailed rules for implementing the preparatory phase which precedes the next Intergovernmental Conference, and on the other there is the issue of the role of the regional bodies in the construction of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of the detailed rules concerning the preparatory phase is concerned, it is too soon yet to take a decision on the content of the Laeken declaration. Most of you, I know, heard what was said by our Prime Minister, and that will have lifted a little corner of the veil. However, most of the canvas which is currently covered by that veil has still to be painted. That being the case, all I can tell you is that it is too soon. However, it is obvious that the preparatory phase will have to take its inspiration from the various contributions which will be made by the European Council in December, and from the discussions and contacts which the Belgian presidency will be having with all the parties concerned. In that respect I can assure you that the presidency has the firm intention of examining every aspect of the question, including those mentioned by the honourable Members, so that the detailed rules for implementing preparations for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference will provide the optimum response to the initial requirements set out in the Nice Declaration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say, however, that in his speech, as in the answer that he has just given to our questions, for which I thank him, I noted the absence of any explicit reference to the political recognition of national and cultural diversity which, together with statehood, is a fundamental element of the European character. Within this diversity, the stateless nations that we represent have genuine historical and linguistic roots, as well as demographic and economic importance on a par with those of the Member States. We would like to see acknowledgement of our political, civic and democratic realities, together with the executive, legislative and judicial powers that distinguish us, so that we are able to participate in the European Council, just as we also acknowledge that federal states, Länder and constitutional regions that have a different nature but similar powers must participate. We would like to see these realities incorporated into the Laeken Declaration. We would like these realities to be included in the future Constitution.

<p class="contents">As you know, Madam Minister, Catalonia is more than just a region. It is a nation, a nation which has always been a courageous defender of liberty and has always been concerned with solidarity values. Catalonia is a deeply Europhile nation, and yet today that nation has some difficulty in finding its place in this institution. It cannot be content with the makeshift role which it has been granted in the Committee of the Regions, a committee whose powers, as you know, are extremely limited. This is why, knowing your position and your history, I hoped, and indeed still hope, that your presidency will enable progress to be made on this issue, not only the issue of Catalonia, but also the issue of all the other nations without a State of their own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am able to speak from experience. Mr Mayol, you will find that your mandate is an absolutely extraordinary one, but one which is nonetheless worth the trouble. I hope that your years here will be fruitful, pleasant and interesting. You will certainly have to work hard, but something tells me that you are not afraid of hard work. So, once again, my best congratulations!</p>
<p class="contents">Actually I do know a little about Catalonia. I do not speak Catalan but I can understand it, which is something at least. The problem you have raised is obviously even more complex than the issue of constitutional regions within the boundaries of a single country. You are talking about a nation which straddles two countries, if you will allow me to put it so cavalierly, both of which are anxious to maintain their territorial integrity. I am happy to leave you with the responsibility for the prospects which you have opened up.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I completely agree with you when you emphasise the fact that the Catalans love their nation, their language and their culture, but that at the same time they are very European, very open to the world outside. I can tell you that we are not unaware of the fact that the Prime Minister of Spanish Catalonia was one of the first people to launch the movement in favour of constitutional regions. If I know him, and I know him well and have confidence in him, that movement will certainly not come to a halt, and as long as it keeps going it will be skilfully conducted. Mr Pujol and the other Prime Ministers will see to that. To that extent I believe that the debate will progress in the right direction in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that you are not unaware, precisely because of the protocol to which you referred, that a certain number of Councils of Ministers will be presided over by ministers of regional and/or community governments. This has already happened in the case of the informal Tourism Council which took place last weekend in Bruges, and it will also happen in the case of the Education and Scientific Research Councils, and some of the other Councils too.</p>
<p class="contents">You can see, then, how we deal with questions of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the possibility of access to the Court of Justice is concerned, I know that this is something that the constitutional regions are asking for. Sometimes I have the impertinence to wonder whether they are fully aware of the scope and the possible consequences of a positive reply to their requests. You yourself have pointed out that if the regions had direct access to the Court of Justice in disputes about competence, it would seem almost inevitable that the Court would one day be called upon to give a ruling on the internal constitutional organisation of the Member States themselves. I would ask you to think about that. It is not possible for me to reply to your question. It is a very delicate question, and a very controversial one. Any reply would be quite premature. However, if you will permit me I would like to ask you think about what I have just said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all: the Council is impressed with the progress made in terms of openness and transparency since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, particularly with the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. The Council would point out to the honourable Member that this Parliament and Council Regulation of 30 May 2001, pursuant to Article 19, will not enter into force until 3 December 2001. Until such time, requests from the public for Council documents will be dealt with as before on the basis of Council Decision 93/731/EC on public access to Council documents. Each of the three institutions involved will therefore need to make the necessary arrangements to guarantee that the new Regulation is actually in force as of 3 December 2001. In accordance with Article 15, they shall establish an interinstitutional committee to examine best practice, address possible conflicts and discuss future developments on public access to documents. As far as the Council is concerned, the competent bodies are currently looking into the measures that need to be taken in order to fully implement the rights of citizens which they have acquired on the basis of the new Regulation. I can add to this that it is this presidency’s ambition, wherever possible, to be able to conclude all agreements before this Regulation enters into force, but as I have said before, we cannot do this on our own, and I hope we will receive the necessary support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The country has been refused the aid promised at Helsinki on the grounds that the EU did not have the financial resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not time for the Council to ensure that the Helsinki summit decisions to treat Turkey on an equal footing with the other twelve candidate countries are now honoured and that the channels are opened for that country to obtain the aid it was promised, particularly in view of the fact that the Commission recently decided to refund 11.6 billion euro to the Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has begun the procedure of consulting the European Parliament, and is encouraging Parliament to give its opinion as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Concerning the funding under the ISPA and SAPAR programmes, to which the honourable Member refers, this is structural aid and aid for agricultural development which is only granted to the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe to meet their specific needs as transitional economies. However, that does not mean that Turkey has missed out on the aid promised in Helsinki, on the contrary. The financial preaccession aid for Turkey has been doubled in 2000 and 2001 compared to the average annual amounts which were allocated in the 1996-1999 period. In view of normal budget procedures, we should aim to continue to grant this aid for the remaining part of the current financial perspectives. That is until 2006, as you know, and applies to all candidate countries. I should also like to point out that the EU’s general budget contains a new component, entitled ‘Preaccession strategy for Turkey’, in which the resources are increased in the light of this. As this budget line comprises different budget resources, the financial aid programmes for Turkey can be completed with greater efficiency. As you know, the European Parliament has approved this approach in its opinion on the framework regulation for Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore a great pleasure for me to be able to reply to the question that you have so judiciously raised.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out in my previous replies to questions on the same subject, the Council entirely shares the honourable Member’s concern about the disastrous position in which large sections of the Afghan population now find themselves, and in particular the disastrous position of women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the difficulties in Afghanistan at humanitarian and political levels, and in particular in view of the negative attitude which the Taleban persist in taking, both as regards the UN and as regards women, the Council is not entirely convinced that the setting up of an international Afghanistan committee in coordination with the UN, would be likely to really improve the situation of women in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Council will examine closely the advantages and disadvantages to which such a committee might give rise, as soon as this issue is raised within the UN, and provided that the rules for putting such a proposal into practice have been studied in minute detail. In the meantime, the Council will be continuing the projects which it has decided on with the aim of helping Afghan women. On that point, the Council would also refer the honourable Member to the replies which it has already given to previous questions on the same subject, and in particular to Questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0032_EN.html">H-0032/01</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0052_EN.html">H-0052/01</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0170_EN.html">H-0170/01</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0088_EN.html">H-0088/01</a> and, more recently, Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0481_EN.html">H-0481/01</a>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
