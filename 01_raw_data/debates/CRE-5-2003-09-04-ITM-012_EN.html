If the new Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, is really serious about his roadmap to democracy, he will immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues and give them an important role in this process. He presented this roadmap a few days ago behind closed doors, without the presence of the media or foreign diplomats. The plan is supposedly to set up a convention for a new constitution, which should lead to fair and free elections. As no information was given as to the how and when of this plan, the only conclusion I can draw is that the military regime is trying to sidetrack the West and is hoping to break out of its isolation. As it must not, of course, be allowed to succeed in this, I support the Council's decision to tighten the sanctions. Any remaining business contacts should be completely severed. The Commission and the Council, in cooperation with the United Nations, should continue to appeal for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues. She has been held illegally for more than three months, during which time she has gone on hunger strike. The international community must make the Burmese authorities responsible for her well-being and the Red Cross must gain access to her. Pressure from the neighbouring countries in the ASEAN – China, India and Japan – must be stepped up. Fortunately, the United States has also been very forthright in its opinion about the current situation and has expressly pledged its support to Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma is still the pariah of the international community. The military junta sees the enforcement of its own power as more important than the suffering of the Burmese people. The generals' roadmap to democracy has so far only led to prison. This is not only about the liberation of Aung San Suu Kyi, but also about the liberation of the Burmese people as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the first occasion I carried a letter from President Klaus Hänsch informing Aung San Suu Kyi of the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to her. Khin Nyunt, the current Prime Minister, played a central role in ensuring I did not have the opportunity to deliver that letter in person.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second occasion I was able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi clandestinely. On that occasion my colleagues and I were able to obtain her clear support for sanctions against the military regime in Burma. I hope the Council and the Commission recognise that is the view of the National League for Democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">30 August marked three months of detention at the end of 13 years of open prison for Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy. The State Peace and Development Council – the former SLORC – has harassed the people of Burma, the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time she was visited was in July. On 31 August the United States reported she was on hunger strike. The regime denies that. If that is the case, the absolute minimum the authorities can do is to enable the international community to reassure itself of her wellbeing.</p>
<p class="contents">As for free and fair elections, the problem in Burma is not free and fair elections – those took place 13 years ago – but that the military regime is not prepared to accept the will of the Burmese people.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that ASEAN started to get involved in this process at its ministerial meeting in June. We welcome the pressure they put on Burma and note that the current military regime has refused to allow them to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand her immediate release and that of all political prisoners, which would be a major step towards the restoration of democracy. We call on the Council and the Commission to show their readiness, in collaboration with the United States, to help facilitate the national reconciliation process in Burma. In the meantime, we ask the Council to introduce tough further measures targeted against the regime, its members and their interests. They should be imposing smart sanctions that hurt those people in power. We call on the Council and Member States to ask the United Nations Security Council to urgently address the situation in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN emissaries and the representatives of the Red Cross have not been able to visit her regularly. Last July a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross was probably the last contact that Aung San Suu Kyi had with the outside world. No one has seen her since.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in the same way that the dictator denied secretly holding the young woman, the Burmese authorities are denying her hunger strike, made public on 31 August by the US State Department. The imprisonment and arrest of militants of the National League for Democracy in May quite rightly gave rise to much feeling in the world. The US took the opportunity to reinforce their economic sanctions on the Rangoon regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the – no doubt demagogic – use of this announcement by the US cannot, however, hide the severity of the regime nor its hypocrisy in promising an official roadmap destined to restore democracy. This programme, which includes, and I quote, ‘free and fair elections and a new Constitution’, still does not fix a timetable and remains silent on the release of the leader of the opposition. It happened after the junta showed its desire to not respect any of the democratic demands of its people, and this is a bad omen. The results of the 1990 elections which, let us remember, were a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, were not recognised by the armed forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The Association of South-East Asian Nations now threatens to exclude Burma from its members. It had hoped for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi before its next summit in Bali in October. As for the European Union, it should do everything possible to compel the military junta to free the Nobel Prize winner. In collaboration with the United Nations, the Council and the Commission should now show their determination, through strict sanctions, to do something practical in the process of democratisation in Burma. Political pressure should increase. Under the rule of one of the fiercest dictators, in the hands of a head of government who has held the duties of head of services of the military information for forty years, the Burmese people need all our solidarity. The worry such as that for the lady of Rangoon is a genuine one. Let us listen to the opposition, which has just declared that this hunger strike is a declaration that the Burmese generals are slowly but surely poisoning her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is absolutely unequivocal in its demand: the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi. I hope this message is now being heard by the Burmese regime. Aung San Suu Kyi is a symbol of resistance to tyranny and personifies the hopes of the people of Burma for freedom. She has spent eight of the last thirteen years under some form of detention or restriction and on 30 May 2003 she was seized again and has been held virtually incommunicado, to all intents kidnapped by the regime in a military barracks in the Ye Mon district of Rangoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Four days ago it was reported that she was on hunger strike and that she was in a serious condition. The International Committee of the Red Cross must be given immediate access to her in order to assist in the provision of emergency assistance. Given the policy of the ICRC not to reveal the detention conditions of those that it visits, Aung San Suu Kyi should also be seen by Italian Ambassador Miniero, on behalf of the European Union, or by Her Majesty's Ambassador to Burma, Vicky Bowman.</p>
<p class="contents">These should be just the preliminaries to her release and to the release of scores of other National League for Democracy members and organisers, elected Members of Parliament, senior Party officials and students detained following the violent attack on opposition elements on 30 May 2003. Each member of the State Peace and Development Council that runs Burma must be held personally responsible for the health, safety and wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">They must be put on notice that action will be taken against them. General Khin Nyunt, the newly-appointed Prime Minister, has talked about a roadmap to democracy. Let him show that he is serious, lift the barrier on that road, respond to our calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners and recognise the results of the 1990 elections which gave a landslide victory to the National League for Democracy. To encourage him, much more needs to be done to increase the pressure on his military dictatorship in Burma. Action should now be taken to strengthen the EU sanctions with moves to deny Burmese dictatorship the hard currency it uses to fund its repression.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have seen in other countries such as Zimbabwe, quiet diplomacy does not work. Neighbouring ASEAN countries need to do more to bring about change in Burma. I call on the Council presidency and the Commission to take urgent action, to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, to bring about her immediate release and, in case the SPDC does not respond in a positive way, to draw up new measures that can quickly be taken against the Burmese regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In June, we called for the speedy introduction of democracy and for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained in what was at the time a secret location. She has, since 1988, been campaigning for more democracy, and was awarded our Sakharov Prize in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. It was partly through our pressure that representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross were able to visit her.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, no prospect of democracy being introduced with any sort of urgency. Although the new Burmese Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, published, on 30 August, a roadmap for free elections by secret ballot, no firm date has been set for them. My fellow Members are right not to set too much store by promises of democracy and such things as the summoning of a constitutional convention, for it is the armed forces who take decisions on all important matters, and the convention will have no influence on them whatever. Aung San Suu Kyi has been on hunger strike since 31 August in order to make a forceful protest against her detention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, too, have done with half measures! The EU’s imposition of a visa ban and its freezing of the overseas assets of Burmese associates of the regime are nothing like enough. As a community of values, one that exalts the maintenance of democracy and human rights as its supreme principle, the EU must take a hard line with the junta in Rangoon. Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters must be released from detention at last. The results of the free elections in 1990 must be accepted, power must be handed over to the forces of democracy, and the roadmap must be implemented, but under international supervision. Commissioner Nielson, I urge you to press for tougher action to be taken and for further sanctions to be imposed. These should, I believe, include an embargo on goods imported from Burma and a boycott of tourism in that country. That, perhaps, will be the sort of language they will understand.</p>

<p class="contents">The SPCD's announcement to restart the National Convention that would lead to free and fair elections has to be taken with caution. In the 15 years the regime has ruled Burma there has not been a single democratic reform. In fact the human rights situation in Burma has become worse.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be a very clear message from the European Union that relentless pressure will be applied to the Burmese regime. Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi and the other political prisoners must be released immediately. We should be prepared to strengthen our sanctions to encourage the SPDC to relinquish its grip on power and fully respect the results of the last elections. Exports of oil, gas, gems, minerals and timber which provide the majority of the regime's income, could be targeted. as could the refusal of visas and freezing of assets. Dictators and their regimes and families should not be allowed to leave their country or to acquire any assets abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as increasing the sanctions against the regime, it is vital the EU should try to secure the cooperation and support of Asian countries, in particular Burma's neighbouring countries. International pressure is necessary to force the regime to respond positively.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi reported to be on hunger strike, the EU should intensify its actions to secure her release and the release of other detained NLD members and to support democratic change in Burma. We should use our liberty to promote theirs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has set the problem out very well. There is clearly a very serious problem, and Aung San Suu Kyi should be released immediately. It is unacceptable that a delegation from this Parliament is not allowed, and has been refused, permission to visit her.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a real need for the other states in the region to maximise the pressure for her immediate release and to ensure that free elections concur with that. I have to ask how long will the European Union and the United Nations drag their feet and stand back before they increase the pressure for the early release of those held in prison? There is an urgent need for immediate action. Words are easy, what we need now is for the roadmap to be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon dismisses this information as 'groundless'. Other sources indicate, however, that the pro-Democracy leader is indeed on hunger strike. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that an independent body be given the opportunity to immediately visit Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is completely unacceptable. The regime’s argument that her detention was 'temporary' and 'protective' lacks all credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has repeatedly demanded immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other leading representatives of the Burmese National League for Democracy and will continue to do so. The junta has to understand that her release will serve the interests of the regime, as it has declared its desire to move on in the process of national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has declared itself ready to actively support the process of national reconciliation in Burma/Myanmar. But as long as Aung San Suu Kyi and other activists of the National League for Democracy remain in prison, the basic preconditions for this process do not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Any serious plan to bring about political change in Burma will need to incorporate a timeframe which gives a clear perspective for the process of national reconciliation. We fully agree with the honourable Members of Parliament that this process will also need the support of the international community. In this context we would like to reiterate our support for the efforts undertaken by UN Special Envoy Ambassador Razali.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time for the regime in Rangoon to act. If the new government under Prime Minister Khin Nyunt truly has intentions to work towards democracy and political reform, the first step would be to release Aung San Suu Kyi now and to immediately start a dialogue between the various parties concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
