<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cerdeira Morterero (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, in the European Union there are 12 million legal immigrants from third countries. Entry and residence for reasons of family reunification is, in almost all the Member States of the Union, the main route for legal immigration by nationals of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This family immigration consists of both family reunification in the strict sense – the reunification of family members with a third-country national who is already resident – and the reunification of a family when the family ties are established after the entry of the third-country national.</p>
<p class="contents">Persons authorised to enter as family members, as a percentage of all immigrants, varies from 40 to 50%, and this figure is even higher in certain Member States of the Union such as France or the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">While recognising the importance of this aspect of legal immigration in quantitative terms, it is also important to stress the fundamental role played by family reunification as a necessary means for achieving the integration of third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The presence of family members provides these people with greater stability and greater integration, by allowing them to lead a normalised family life. The majority of family members admitted on the basis of the right to family reunification have a great advantage, compared to other types of immigrant, since they already maintain very close links with a person – the person who is being reunified with their family – who is already established in the receiving country, which makes it far easier for them to integrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation on family reunification must be governed by two principles, which must also be applied in all legislation on immigration. These principles, which have been repeated on other occasions, are equality and security.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go back over the whole history of this proposed directive we are discussing today, since I assume you are aware of it, but I must refer to the first political agreement on legal immigration which was reached at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 February, on the Council Directive on the right to family reunification. This agreement is in many respects far from what this Parliament is proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the difficulties involved in reaching agreements on such sensitive issues as immigration issues, which are approached and regulating in very different specific ways in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal as presented today for the approval of this Parliament, includes as members of the family the partner of the person in question, as well as the unmarried partner recognised in the Member State, regardless of the sex; the minor children of the person in question and of their partner, including adopted children; the minor children, also including adopted children of the person in question and their partner when one of them has the right to custody and is caring for them; but we have not accepted the exception relating to children of over 12 years old according to which the Member State could examine whether or not they comply with integration criteria before authorising their entry and residence in accordance with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Parents with difficulties in the country of origin have been included if they do not have any other family support. And adult children with health problems have also been included. The time limit for communicating the decision made is reduced from 9 to 6 months and from 12 to 9 months in exceptional cases.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conditions for exercising the right to family reunification, we maintain the reasons of public order, security and public health when it comes to granting that right. It will not be possible to deny renewal of the permit because of illnesses subsequent to the issuing of that permit. And refugees are exempted from the requirement that they must prove they are in a position to maintain their families.</p>
<p class="contents">I have withdrawn all the amendments relating to subsidiary protection in exchange for a commitment from the Commission to present a directive to harmonise this issue in the European Union as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the entry and residence of family members, we propose bringing the right to access to education, employment and professional training into line with that of members of the family of the person in question and not to that of the citizens of the Union. This will prevent differing treatment within a single family.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of widowhood, divorce, separation or death an autonomous residence permit may be obtained if the person in question has been resident for at least one year.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, there are certain aspects which I believe to be positive, such as: the exemption of refugees from the requirement that they must demonstrate that they are in a position to maintain their families, the adoption of flexible criteria with regard to refugees in relation to proof of kinship and authorisation of alternative proof in the event that documentary proof is not a possibility; furthermore, family members are generally granted the same residence rights as the head of the family, family members are granted the same rights in terms of access to education, self-employed and salaried work and to family guidance and the special needs of unaccompanied minors are recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, however, that the political agreement reached on 28 February is far from what this Parliament proposed in certain areas, because it reduces its scope and it is required that there is a reasonable prospect of obtaining the right to long-term residence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would repeat that I have decided to withdraw all the amendments which included people receiving subsidiary protection in the scope in exchange for a commitment from the Council to approve the directive presented by the Commission on 12 September 2001, on the minimum rules on the requirements and status available to third-country citizens and stateless persons in order to be refugees or beneficiaries or other types of international protection, which would include the right to family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons and for the reasons that have been fully explained previously in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home affairs, I would ask this House to support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new amended proposal for a directive on the right to family reunification, on which the European Parliament is to make a decision today, was adopted by the Commission in response to the mandate given by the Heads of State and Government meeting in Laeken on 15 December 2001. The European Council confirmed at that time that a common asylum and immigration policy presupposed the establishment of common rules on the subject of family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council recognised, however, that progress on this was slower and less substantial than expected and that new impetus and new guidelines were needed in order to make up for the delay. To this end, the European Council called on the Council of Ministers to speed up its work and asked it to approve the provisions on family reunification by July 2003. The Commission considers that family reunification is an essential element in the successful integration of third country nationals into European societies. This instrument is for us, therefore, an essential aspect of the common immigration policy proposed by the Commission and was, in fact, the first of all the proposals that the Commission presented to the Council in execution of the Tampere mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">For this amended proposal, the Commission has used a new approach to the points that for two years have led to insurmountable differences between the Member States. This new approach recognises that several stages will be needed to achieve the harmonisation of national laws. This proposal is thus just the first stage towards such harmonisation. To this end, we have enshrined a certain amount of flexibility in several of the instruments, especially in relation to the points that caused differences between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This flexibility is incorporated in two ways: first, as regards the background, through the use of a standstill clause, the idea of which is to prevent Member States from misusing derogations introduced subsequently in relation to the legislation in force at the time this directive is adopted; there is a kind of freeze on the level of protection for family reunification as it exists today in the legislation of the Member States. Secondly, the Commission is introducing a rendezvous clause, which lays down a period of two years after the transposition of the directive and specifies exactly which provisions must be subjected to priority review so as to open up the second phase, the second stage in the process of harmonising national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obviously a question of those provisions that are considered more sensitive, such as the definition of family members and the possibility of also covering family members of Community citizens who have not made use of their right to freedom of movement. The main changes brought in compared with the initial Commission proposal first of all concern the definition of family members: the right to family reunification is guaranteed for the spouse and minor children. With a concern for flexibility, it is specified that a Member State may examine whether a child below twelve years of age meets an integration criterion, but only if its legislation provides for this today or on the date when the directive is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The admission of unmarried partners, relatives in the ascending line and adult children, on the other hand, becomes optional for the Member States, which must decide on this through legislation or regulation. In matters of family reunification procedures, requirements concerning accommodation, material resources and sickness insurance will remain optional. It is expected, however that they can be monitored after reunification when the family members’ residence permits are renewed.</p>
<p class="contents">A derogation will also allow Member States to retain national laws relating to their reception capacity when examining applications for family reunification. In such cases, depending on the reception capacity, applications may be dealt with in stages, provided that the family members’ waiting period is not longer than three years. Lastly, the provisions dealing with the family reunification of refugees were put together in the same chapter to reflect better the specific nature of their situation. Overall, the proposal falls short of our initial intentions but it does not, however, involve any obligation to harmonise family reunification requirements downwards, and we see it as a first step on a path that we wish were faster but which we shall continue to tread with conviction and persistence. I thank the rapporteur and Parliament for supporting this debate throughout the three long years that our journey together has taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the third proposal presented by the Commission on this subject since 1999, and once the directive has been adopted by the Council, it will soon be transposed into the national law of every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament are asked today to deliver our opinion on a solution to the problem of reunifying the families of non-EU citizens, a solution that is both humane and realistic. It gives people from non-EU countries the chance to live in and with their families in the European Union while also avoiding a drastic increase in the level of immigration into our Member States. After several years of hard bargaining with the Council, the Commission has now finally adopted a realistic and practicable approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, critical – as I was with the initial proposal – of the Commission’s decision not to differentiate between the various reasons for immigration. Accordingly, I call once again on behalf of my group for separate directives on family reunification – one for asylum-seekers, one for migrant workers and one for subsidiary protection. By dealing with subsidiary protection – that is to say the granting of temporary residence rights to people in need of protection – in a separate directive, the Commission has now taken a step in the right direction, a step we have been encouraging it to take. It would have been logical to do likewise for asylum-seekers and migrant workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Extending reunification to non-marital and same-sex partnerships and children belonging to people in these partnerships, for which Mrs Cerdeira Morterero argues in her report, is something that we categorically reject. Who, for example, is supposed to verify the existence of such relationships? I totally fail to understand why the door is being deliberately thrown wide open to abuse. I can only recommend to the ideologists of this House that they try to get in touch with those who work at the sharp end in the Member States. They are the ones who have to cope on a daily basis with unclear regulations and a considerable caseload of abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">If people-smugglers are already being paid huge sums of money by those who want to enter the European Union illegally, risking their lives in the process, it is easy to imagine the sort of money that will soon be changing hands to enable people to enter the EU quite legally as so-called partners. The Commission’s proposal that the reunification of these categories of people should be at the discretion of the Member States is not convincing either, because it gives too much scope, in my view, to individual countries in a united Europe with open borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of supporting the realistic and practical approach which I proposed in my first report and which has since received widespread endorsement in the Council and the Commission, the left-wing majority are continuing to romp about here in their ideological playground. By persisting with their unrealistic proposals, they are playing into the hands of those Member States that have no wish to consent to codecision rights for the European Parliament in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">In this specific case, I am in the unaccustomed position of welcoming the fact that we are only being consulted on this matter. The Council has already reached a political agreement to accept the Commission draft. The Council, at its meeting on 8 May, can therefore be expected to base its decision on the Commission’s draft, which is a more realistic document. For this reason, my wish for today and for the future is that our decisions should not be coloured by ideological party manifestos but that, in the parliamentary processes which are still pending, we should agree on constructive, practical and coherent policies that the people of our countries can endorse.</p>

Imagine from now on that you are included in the scope of this directive and that we are talking about your husbands, wives and children. I believe that would be a good exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cerdeira Morterero. She had a very difficult job to do. The Commission's first proposal was well received by this House. We made certain proposals which have not been taken into account, and not only that, but as a result of the debates of the absent Council we have received a new proposal which we do not like nearly so much. Despite this, the rapporteur has made an effort to find a way to move forward, since we believe this is a very important element of immigration policy which should be established as soon as possible. We therefore accept many of the new proposals presented to us, we accept the basis on which they are founded, we accept the idea of having to demonstrate the capacity to maintain the family, we are prepared to wait for an agreement on a new proposal on subsidiary protection, but there are certain things which, despite everything, we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept a limitation of entry for minor children for any reason, and this appears obvious to us. We cannot accept the extension of time limits and we cannot accept – we do not like it at all – the number of exceptions which, despite the goodwill of the Commission, appear in the proposal. Despite this, and without much success, we in the PSE are prepared to reach an agreement and continue talking.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as I have said, we are talking about family life. I imagine that the PPE-DE agrees that this is the basis of our society. We cannot accept a proposal which raises to three years – and three years and nine months if we include the procedure – the period during which a man and more and more often a woman – please bear this in mind – has to wait before having their children with them? Do you know what happens to a child between four and seven years old or between seven and twelve years old? Is it reasonable to create so much disquiet amongst people who we want to live within our society?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pose a question: would it not be better to recognise that we human beings live in families? Could we not create laws which make it easier for families to enter? Would this not be more practical? In exchange, I would be prepared to talk about the inclusion in the quotas of people who come to work, inclusion in the open coordination method, and in these quotas, of people who come for purposes of family reunification. But I believe that that would really be a more practical policy in terms of integrating these citizens into our society.</p>

Although it has taken a long time to get this report through Parliament, that does not give the Council an excuse to disregard Parliament’s role in the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I believe that the directive concerns a very central area of the debate on immigration and integration. It is a fact that family reunifications among third country citizens contribute between 40 and 50% of the total number of immigrants into the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will help to produce greater clarity concerning the rules, improved integration and a fairer distribution of the burden within the Community. At the same time, the directive gives the Member States sufficient opportunities to prevent inadvertent economic immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be emphasised that family reunification helps to secure values that are entirely fundamental to every individual: the family unit and a normal family life. On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have supported the proposed amendment that creates a wider definition of family and also brings third country citizens with subsidiary protection within the rules on family reunification. At the same time, however, I do not consider it wrong for us to link certain requirements to the rules on family reunification. I still believe that the Member States must have the opportunity to set requirements, for example in the form of a normal standard of accommodation, an income that ensures that the family can be provided for, and respect for public order and security, as well as the opportunity to establish a waiting period.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my wish that this report will be adopted with as much support as possible in this House, and that the Council will then in future listen to the advice we give it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the case, for example, with regard to the ending of discrimination in the field of family reunification. But we might ask ourselves whether it is not a question of a fool’s bargain, as asserted by certain fellow Members, since the Council already reached an agreement in February, with which Commissioner Vitorino was satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore allow me, in turn, to express doubts over the desire to take the opinion of the European Parliament into account. Allow me also to express extreme concern over the current trend where several countries of the Union are hardening their migration policies. For example, we understand why the French Government called this agreement – an important part of the policy on the control of migration flows. While harmonisation of national laws is necessary, is this taking place based on compliance with the rights and protection of third-country nationals, in the very spirit of the Tampere agreements, or will the transposal of this directive on the contrary be the pretext, for some, for a reduction in the level of protection already guaranteed by the Member States? By increasing the conditions of entry, for example, for children and choosing between qualified and non-qualified job-seekers, Europe is becoming a fortress. This policy plays no part in creating a European citizenship which upholds the values of tolerance, democracy and solidarity in accordance with, in particular, the Geneva Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a real opportunity for the Union: immigrant populations should instead take advantage of free movement and a welcome which enables them to participate in local life and have a reasonable income. We would be a long way from the fantasy of invaders in that case. In this respect, the 2002 report on the Continuous Reporting System on Migration set up by the OECD re-establishes the truth. In France, whether the Minister of the Interior likes it or not, the total number of permanent entries totalled 119 000 people in 2002, that is, less than the figure for 1998, and the principal reason for this migration remains, in 77% of cases, family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, following the example of human rights associations, I am today anxious to condemn actions which the Danish Presidency in a way allowed in its Return Action Programme of November 2002. I refer to chartering flights which are loaded with ‘undesirables’. It will have taken barely four months for Mr Sarkozy in France to disappear into this organisation of forced returns, shameful for this day and age, and above all, a far cry from a humane and fair immigration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this connection, we should remember that the Council has already laid down a general approach, on 27 February this year.</p>
<p class="contents">While the right to live with one’s family is recognised by international conventions and referred to in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is disgraceful to see that the Council’s approach casts serious doubts over this right for residents from third countries. If we take into consideration the Tampere Summit, which sought to establish a common approach in order to guarantee, in accordance with human rights instruments, the integration of third-country nationals legally resident in the Union, this new approach is a genuine downward adjustment. As certain Members are saying, it is true that this directive is better than nothing when we know of the difficulties encountered to reach this point. But we cannot avoid condemning its minimalist aspect, despite all the goodwill of the rapporteur, whom we sincerely thank for her work.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, allow me to make some criticisms. Why exclude people who enjoy temporary protection or subsidiary protection status? Excluded from the asylum system by this proposal, they have become rightless. They are also excluded from all the directives on third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, why restrict family reunification purely to the legal spouse and dependent children under certain circumstances? Nothing justifies making the admission of minors over 12 years old subject to the condition for integration, or excluding minor children over 15 years old. The definition of a third-country national child should be the same as that of another European child. A child is a child. Whatever his nationality, he has the right to live with his parents. This provision appears to run counter to Member States’ international obligations on children’s rights. Such inconsistencies are unjustified and unjustifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the length of the procedure, as soon as the application for family reunification is submitted, it must be possible for this to take effect within a reasonable time. A waiting time of three years of marriage is much too long. We do not ask Europeans to have been married for three years before they can live together. Yet the principle of the right to live as a family is simple. When a foreigner legally resident in a Union Member State holds a residence permit valid for one year, the right to family reunification should be automatic.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with this restrictive proposal, family life is in danger of becoming an ordeal, especially for women. In actual fact, the directive stipulates that the grant of a residence permit is limited to a period of one year and is renewable under certain circumstances. Now, the permit issued should have the same duration as that of the spouse. The stipulated period of five years before an autonomous residence permit is granted to the spouse is much too long. The lack of legal autonomy often makes women totally dependent on their husbands, which is unacceptable in a Europe that upholds women’s rights. Moreover, given that access to employment for members of the family is not a right from the moment of entry, this forces one of the spouses to bear all the expenses and block any social integration of the other spouse.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive is the result of a philosophy which conflicts with that adopted last year. Not only does it conflict with the talk of integration urged by many of those involved, but it also incites immigrants’ children to violent reactions in the face of the injustice experienced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea is always the same: to promote ever more immigration in Europe and to make the right to family reunification the driving force behind this Community policy. One month ago, the European Union's Justice and Home Affairs Council reached a difficult consensus on the directive on family reunification. Today the rapporteur is proposing to amend this compromise, that she considers to be too restrictive, because it does not go far enough in advocating the right to extended family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">What is actually proposed here is an extension of the definition of family member to include unmarried partners, children of full age and relatives in the ascending line if they have no other means of support. But who is going to decide whether the fact that they have no other means of support is legally significant? Even a homosexual partnership, for instance, is seen here as equivalent to a family relationship. Nevertheless, it states, the relationship will have to be stable and long term. What a joke! But the floodgates have been opened. They have for all applicants. This means that if just one person comes in almost fifteen more will be able to settle with them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not unsympathetic to the fact that some foreign families have to live apart. But if you want to avoid their being uprooted as a result, why do you never consider, in these times of unemployment, the possibility of organising family reunification in the countries of origin? And why not devote a portion of our development funds to this, as all too often these funds actually only serve to take money from the pockets of the poor in rich countries to line the pockets of the rich in poor countries. Is this the real purpose of family reunification? Should it not instead be focused on the migrants' countries of origin?</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever we denounce this immigration of colonisation, which is organised by the Member States with the active collusion of the European institutions: our right to asylum is a mess; border checks have been abandoned; illegal immigrants are having their positions legalised; marriages of convenience are flourishing, and so on. All of this must stop. It is our duty to put an end to this suicidal policy that is being pursued by Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore pleased that, at least now at the third attempt, the proposal presented by the Commission is based on a sound approach, and we support it, not least because it incorporates many of our parliamentary proposals, particularly those made by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it especially encouraging, for the sake of the labour market in the European Union, the social safety net and the interests of the Union with regard to the integration of non-EU nationals, that the concept of the family introduced in this draft is that of the nuclear family, in other words that the family as defined in the draft is restricted to parents and minor children. I also find it encouraging that the Council has already given its political approval to this proposal and that we can expect the final adoption of the directive based on this narrow definition of the family to be effected in the month of May.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us, on the other hand, which we are now discussing, is a very definite backward step, a return to the Stone Age, as it were, of immigration policy. It quite simply ignores the realities and opportunities that exist in our Member States. For example, by redefining the family, you are calling for the extension of the directive to unmarried partners, adult offspring and other relatives. You even go so far as to ask for the immigration of second and third wives and their children. That, if I may say so, is inconsistent with the tradition and culture of Europe. You call for shorter time limits, and you seek to curb Member States’ scope to impose appropriate restrictions through their own national laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal presented by the Commission is sound. We in the Group of the European People’s Party shall support it. We utterly reject, however, the proposals tabled by the rapporteur, which would extend the concept of family far beyond the limits that the European Union can accept as a tolerable basis for its immigration policy.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, from a procedural point of view, while I realise it is due to unavoidable delays on the part of this Parliament, it is unacceptable that, as Mr Sørensen said, the Council has already reached its general agreement on this without waiting for Parliament's opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, colleagues will be aware that the UK has chosen at this stage, for well-documented reasons by way of a protocol, not to opt into this directive, but I sincerely hope that in the future it will be able to opt in. I therefore welcome the course that the rapporteur has taken with regard to subsidiary protection.</p>
<p class="contents">As others have said, we should recognise the importance of this agreement because it is the first legislative instrument to be passed at European level on legal immigration. If we are aware of the difficulties the Commissioner faced in making any progress on this issue, then we should recognise the very great challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Klamt's remarks and her interpretation saddened me. On family unification, I would say to Mr Gollnisch that I can well understand, if there were members of his family who were separated from him by thousands of kilometres, that they would not want family reunification – they would be grateful to be parted from him. But if it were members of my family who were separated and somewhere else in the world – whatever the relationship or their situation – I would welcome this and would hope that we could have family reunification that would draw us together.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said, we have to be realistic in our approach to, and modern in our interpretation of, relationships and to show understanding for the circumstances that people find themselves in nowadays. This Parliament has to be realistic, rational and forward-looking. I look forward to supporting this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it does not go far enough and some of the amendments proposed are a step backwards and we will reject them.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to family reunification has to be an absolute right. In fact the report seems to be primarily concerned with placing limitations on this right on a wide variety of pretexts so as to prevent it from facilitating so-called illegal immigration. This motivation, which is despicable from a human point of view, reduces the scope of the few positive aspects of the text. Society is so lacking in egalitarian values and there is so much poverty in the world that more and more poor people are trying to escape hunger and suffering and find refuge in the countries of Europe; all too often they unfortunately fail to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The national States and the European institutions can put up all the barbed wire they like, both literally and in legal terms, to prevent this happening, but they will not succeed. The measures of constraint to turn away those who are fleeing poverty only serve to show the inhumanity of those who take and support these measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I was researching for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on issues relating to the migration of workers, I was told by employers' organisations that family reunification was a crucial factor in people's decisions on whether or not they were going to come and work in the European Union. They wanted to know whether their spouses or their partners would be able to work; they wanted to know what access to education their children would have; and they also wanted to know which of their children were not going to be allowed in and were maybe going to have to stay with other relatives while they did exams at the ages of fifteen, sixteen and so forth. So if the European Union is serious in what it is saying about labour market flexibility and the need for workers of certain categories, we have to think very carefully whether we are going to say to the people that we want to come to work as company directors, doctors, IT specialists, chefs or whatever, ‘well sorry, you need to split your family up, you will need to wait for up to three years before you can bring them in.’ People like that have a choice, and they will choose not to come here.</p>
<p class="contents">My group and I do not feel that we are talking about 1st and 2nd class families. All families want to stay together and they have a right under international law and agreements to stay together. The report that Parliament is putting forward recognises that there are different relationships now. We have to recognise the facts of life and we have to keep families together, particularly if we want to have the sort of economy that we feel we are entitled to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the proposal for a directive on family reunification has been rearing its ugly head in the European Parliament periodically since 1999. The reason for this game of ping-pong is simple: first, the Commission makes an over-liberal proposal; the European Parliament approves it and raises the bid even higher; finally, the Council – which appears to be the most responsible of the three – says no and the cycle starts all over again.</p>
<p class="contents">This time the Commission thinks it has found an invincible weapon. It keeps a low profile on most of the provisions contested by the Council as if it were giving in, but introduces a new Article 19 at the end of the text explaining that all of these matters will be re-examined no more than two years later. Their tactics are clear. The idea is, at least initially, to gain approval for minimal European legislation on family reunification so as to have the principle of European law and European intervention recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequently, the Commission will use these points in its favour to return to the attack, all the more so given that Article 19 already states which provisions will have to be amended. As for the Council, there is a risk that they will let the text go through because they will all say – as they do all too often: 'the essential points are safe for the time being and as for the rest we will see in two years' time'.</p>
<p class="contents">We think, for our part, that the Council should not allow itself to be caught up in this chain of events. Family reunification accounts for a huge number of immigrants today and it is important for each Member State to retain its ability to keep it under close surveillance, so as to tailor it to its reception capacity. The Commission and the European Parliament dream of imposing an a priori extension of this right on the Member States, but it is out of the question that they would let this happen. We therefore think that this directive would serve no purpose and would be dangerous for the Member States, particularly since the Convention on the Future of Europe is showing a willingness to have all of these issues decided by qualified majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by pointing out that establishing common standards on the question of family reunification is for us an important element in a real common immigration policy. This is an outcome of the Tampere European Council deliberations and was recently confirmed at Laeken. It is, however, a very sensitive subject in which it is natural that national realities should loom large. Hence it is difficult to reach solutions and compromises, which indeed accounts for the fact that this proposal has been under discussion in the Council for almost two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has thus come up with this new proposal; although it is far from ideal, it is certainly feasible and will allow a start to be made on the process of harmonising legislation on admission for family reunification purposes. I must therefore congratulate the Commissioner, Mr António Vitorino, on the pragmatic approach that has made it possible to deal with the points that were still causing problems and include the compromises that have in fact been reached in the Council. I consider this solution of a multi-stage process a judicious one, as it provides for great flexibility on the points where there is still stalemate, while at the same time granting national legislations some room for manoeuvre. I also congratulate him on the provision he has termed a rendezvous, which establishes that this flexibility and derogation will be subject to priority review after two years.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, while congratulating Mrs Carmen Cerdeira Morterero on the work she has done, I have to criticise her attempt to broaden the scope of family reunification too far; I believe this is undesirable not just because it is not possible in this first stage in view of the diversity of national legislation on this subject, but also because it may lead to situations of uncontrolled abuse in which the receiving country is unable to create the necessary conditions for full integration and the peaceful coexistence of foreigners and nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to recall that we have here a directive that is attempting to impose minimum standards, whereby the Member States, according to their traditions and national legislation, have every right to adopt more favourable rules on family reunification. I hope, Mr President, that, regardless of our differences of opinion – which are natural and, in any case, essential in a democracy – we can pool our efforts to set up a clear, transparent legal framework to ensure that legal immigrants are integrated into the receiving countries. Family reunification is certainly one factor in this framework that will encourage the personal stability of the immigrant and support this integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
