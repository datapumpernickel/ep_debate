The Community has been sending aid for many years and is still giving maximum possible assistance, despite the collapse of the State in 1991. The Commission has continued to work with the people of Somalia, who have received an average of EUR 30 million a year under programmes run by European non-governmental organisations and United Nations agencies. The Commission's intervention is based on a policy of strict neutrality between the warring sides and focuses on working in partnership with the local authorities. This strategy could, I think, be called a peace dividend method. It aims to promote the advantages of establishing peace, with an eye on the second stage, which is more proactive and efficient. It is a peace-building method which encourages the emerging administration and closer collaboration with regional and local administrations. The Commission, like the Member States, is encouraging a peaceful solution to the problems within a framework of national reconciliation and has repeatedly supported an end to the violence and called for the UN resolutions imposing an arms embargo on Somalia to be upheld. For the moment, the international community is focusing its efforts on the regional reconciliation initiative in Somalia being promoted by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in the Horn of Africa. This process is being spearheaded by Kenya, with technical support from Ethiopia and Djibouti.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to calls for a representative council of the parties to be set up, I should point out that the Commission and Member States have already expressed their joint support for a council to be set up under the IGAD. This issue has been furthered both through political statements and in the form of funding on the part of the Commission to the tune of EUR 500 000 in order to consolidate the first stage of the peace process. Even though it is not directly involved in organising the reconciliation talks under the IGAD, the Commission feels that regional administrations representing sections of Somali society are included in the important agencies which need to work on settling the conflict in Somalia. It shares the view that a bottom-up approach would complement efforts to set up a central administration. The Commission therefore considers that a final institutional framework should be designed for the future of Somalia, mainly between the Somalis themselves, within the framework of detailed dialogue and democratic consultation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were unable to tackle the issue for a long time, not least because the situation did not allow it. Now, with this Transitional National Government in place, we can discuss Somalia, in the knowledge that we still have quite a long way to go along what is an extremely tortuous path. I believe that Somalia is the only country in the region which is in this situation. We must therefore call, using the intermediary of IGAD, for the Nairobi Conference to take place as soon as possible, with the participation of not just the representatives of the Transitional National Government but all the other representatives and all the leaders controlling the northern and southern regions of the country as well. Indeed, if we do not manage to involve most of the representatives of these territories, we will fail in our purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that thanks are due to Djibouti and Kenya too, which have being acting as mediators for a long time. They have now been joined by Ethiopia, which wields great influence. It is to be hoped that these three countries will succeed in coming up with several proposals to make to the leaders meeting at the Nairobi Conference, which will result in a genuine peace process. We must, of course, endeavour to put forward a solution based on respect for the country’s integrity, although the decision-makers will have to decide whether to give some of the regions of the country specific forms of autonomy. The problems are immense, as the Commissioner said. We need, first and foremost, to demilitarise and disarm the people. That is the main objective. We need to clear the territories of mines and, most importantly, we must isolate the terrorist groups which are present or have established themselves in the country. Moreover, we must define an institutional structure and set in motion a process of introducing democracy and respect for human rights. As the Commissioner stressed, we must be motivated by a spirit of national reconciliation, which fully involves all the parties concerned. Furthermore, the issue of refugees must be addressed: refugees must be able to opt to return freely to their country without risk to their safety. Another serious problem is health: there is a health crisis in this country which requires an urgent response.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as I think, these are the key goals for the Nairobi Conference, it is essential that the conference takes place without delay, before the month is out if possible, for that will allow the European Union to launch aid programmes. These must be more effective and more rapidly implemented than previous programmes. If these goals were achieved, Somalia would be in a position to dialogue with the other countries in the region with a view to setting in motion a vital economic process. Moreover, it would appear that there is hope of the democratic process being launched in Eritrea too, and this makes it possible for the European Union to use the instruments laid down by the Cotonou Agreement to provide an initial structured programme of aid measures for the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that precisely this regional element can create cooperation within the region, encouraging countries such as Somalia, which need help and comprehension but which also need to take courageous decisions which will ensure the full participation of all the regional authorities, to follow the example of other countries in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The authors of the resolution call for assistance from the international community, of course, which is essential, although they also point out that armed clashes have claimed many more civilian victims in recent weeks. However, we have to conclude that national reconciliation is an undertaking which is chiefly the responsibility of the peoples of Somalia. Some progress has been observed in this direction. Indeed, the aim is to prevent instability, to prevent the waves of refugees and to endeavour to repatriate them, to prevent the suffering and the ongoing acquisition of arms as far as is possible, even just by means of temporary measures, for all these factors contribute to the danger of Somalia’s instability having a destabilising effect on other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, as in many others, politics and the often vain attempts to organise a conference are endeavours to find non-violent ways of making progress in situations dominated by violence. Despite the extremely complex, involved situation, in our opinion, the Nairobi Conference must take place as soon as possible and find new ways forward. This is my personal opinion, the opinion of my colleague and, I believe, the opinion of all the other Members too.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these are only expressed hopes. Our document welcomes the initiative to organise a conference, although it is impossible to know as yet whether all the parties will agree to sit down at the same table. It calls on countries which export arms to respect the embargo laid down by the UN Security Council, although we know that if a faction wants to buy arms it will certainly find them on the market. It calls for vigilance to ensure that Somali territory is not used for criminal activities, but it is not clear who will be able to carry out this supervision. The Transitional Government? I am somewhat sceptical about this, given that not even the other actors in the region have full control over their own national territory.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by pointing out that the resolution warns Europe that the Somali question could have a disastrous impact outside the country and informs the Somalis too that the world is in one way or another attentive to their problems and willing to help them. It may be that, for the first time, there is a glimmer of hope that more rational, positive ways out of the crisis will be found. Our duty is to condemn the situation while, at the same time, discussing ways forward. In this regard, I feel that the peace initiative described by Commissioner Diamantopoulou is a way out of at least the worst phase of the Somali crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not so long ago, there was a war in Ethiopia, the Ogaden War, and there was a war in the north of Kenya, the Rift War, and the intention of both wars was to unite all Somalis in one country. If we consider the situation today, it has completely changed. The Somalis are fighting each other more than they do other governments in neighbouring countries in order to reunite Somalia.</p>
<p class="contents">As it would appear today, the country is breaking up into all kinds of groupings. The most stable area seems to be the north, and what was the subject of consultation two years ago, a transitional national government, in actual fact, came to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is now at war with each other, which is a dangerous situation. It means that we in Europe, and other countries in the region, will be receiving many refugees from Somalia, and I do not know whether they will be welcome everywhere. There is also a considerable risk that it is a breeding ground for extremist groupings. We know all too well since 11 September what the implications of that could be.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the European Union do in the current situation? In my view, it should first and foremost apply the special rules of the Cotonou Agreement, because we all know that Somalia was unable to sign this agreement and is not a member of it either; but the special provisions will need to be applied in this instance. This means that we would then be able to alleviate human suffering and grant emergency aid, and I gather that that is what the Commission is doing. However, in the regions that enjoy a certain level of stability, we can start repairing and building roads, hospitals, and suchlike, so that some sense of stability will return to the region. Above all, it is up to the Somalis to solve their problems; we could never do this for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the neighbouring countries is also crucial. In the light of their past, do they really want Somalia to be reunited? This is something that I very much doubt. Someone has already raised the forthcoming IGAD Conference in Nairobi; if I counted correctly, this is the fourteenth in the course of a decade or so. Let us hope that it will be successful this time round. Given the signs, I am not so optimistic as the previous speakers, but in my view, the Italians still know Somalia better than any other nationality in the EU. I hope that they will be proven right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also up to the European Commission to get the EU Member States, in particular, to sing from the same hymn sheet. I have a feeling that if we look at the United Kingdom’s attitude, or Italy's, these are quite different. The European Commission has some missionary work to do in this area too, for which I wish you every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not propose to go over them again. It is, of course, not a very good sign that we are having to put Somalia back on the agenda. It means that there is renewed hostility and that we all are, in fact, extremely anxious about that country ending up in a hopeless war again. This is something we must avoid. The country has now, at least partly, restored peace, and another war situation is thus to be avoided. This is why it is not so helpful that the interim government should call for military interventions. I have no faith in these. We think that other means should be employed.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mooted the idea of a partnership with the local authorities. We can welcome this with open arms, but I should like to add that this should not only be done via Kenya, because in Kenya, it is the men who have all the authority. The women in Somalia have told me that they are the ones who make sure there is food and water available, which is, of course, essential. You will not be insensitive to this, but these women are not in Nairobi. I should also like to ask you to especially consider the refugees. Maybe we ought to ask the Council to stop sending refugees back to Somalia since the situation there is actually not at all safe for a large proportion of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do not believe we ought to have a unitary system at any price. If we need to start from regional autonomy in order to rebuild the Somali state, I can imagine that a federation may be formed, as was also necessary in Ethiopia. In any case, I think that the emergency aid you are planning to grant will remain necessary in any event, and that Europe must back the peace process with vigour and in a spirit of solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution, signed today by some of the political groups, does not take into account what we said in our motion, nor does it address the issues we condemned in questions to the Commission and the Council. It calls upon the European Union to support the Transitional National Government, despite the fact that the government was not democratically elected and that the task of this same Nairobi Conference, which has already been put back from April to July, should be to define the new institutional system and lay down new conditions to ensure that the peace and normalisation process is accompanied by measures to combat terrorism and population aid.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and we are increasingly concerned by the situation in the different Somali regions, the threat of terrorism, the political inaccuracy of the authors of the joint resolution which reveals a disturbing lack of awareness of the facts of the Somali and African situations – I heard someone mention a war in Kenya and there has been no war in Kenya since the time of Kenyatta – and the consequent risks both for the local population and for all the other countries, Europe included, we will vote against a resolution which seeks to take the place of the Nairobi Conference or, in any case, to dictate its outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Somalia’s implosion constitutes a great danger to the country itself, to the region, and also to the rest of the world. Being adrift, the area is unable to control its borders, and has been, certainly in the past, a safe haven for Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p class="contents">The fragmented internal security situation and the diverse agendas of the Arab neighbouring countries could turn this country into another breeding ground for international terrorism. The most dangerous indigenous Islamic organisation linked to Al-Qaeda is Al Itihad. It wants to impose a fundamentalist, Islamic state on all seven million Somali inhabitants. This is a real spectre looming over the 64 million Ethiopians, whose Christian majority and Islamic minority are still living together in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Somalia has sunk into oblivion, while the threat of international Muslim terrorism requires the involvement of the United States, the United Nations and the European Union as a matter of the most pressing urgency. However, closer cooperation with the regional players is required. I therefore welcome the IGAD initiative for a reconciliation conference for Somalia to be held in Nairobi later this month, and hope that all Somali parties will take part unconditionally, as is set out in Paragraph 5. Contrary to the request expressed in paragraph 8 of the motion for a resolution for the European Union to help the national transitional government establish its authority across Somalia, I call on the Council and the Commission not to jump to any conclusions before the Conference. I call for open-ended negotiations. The unified state should not be defended at all costs, but the free world needs to stand against Muslim terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, when I was in the British Parliament I co-chaired the all-party Somali group and I, and my Labour colleague, represented ports of Britain which had substantial Somali residents. That was because of the tradition of people from British Somaliland serving in the British Merchant Navy. As a result of that I learnt a lot about Somalia and Somaliland and I particularly learned what a complex area it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I learnt that in the old flag there were five stars, one for each of the five Somali nations: French Somalia, which is now Djibouti; the British part of Somaliland, which is now part of Somalia; the British part of Kenya, which was made up of Somalis; the Italians with southern Somalia, which is now very much Somalia; and the Ethiopians in Ogaden. As has been said, the Ogadeni Somali community led to a war between Somalia and Ethiopia in an attempt to reunite the Somali peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the European Union's duty to help all the Somali nations. It is also our duty to understand their history. That is what they need now. They need political solutions that respect the five traditions, and support also for the economy, education, health, infrastructure and the security of those nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996 Somalia ranked 172 out of 174 countries on the UNDP's human development index. It was <span class="italic">par excellence</span> a least-developed country. Recent history has seen wars and destruction resulting from that. We have over 100 aid agencies working in Somalia. As the Commissioner has highlighted, the European Union and the Member States are the largest donors to the area, giving some EUR 60 million in all, compared with EUR 26 million from the Americans. But let us also remember the Somali diaspora, which brings back some EUR 400 million per annum to the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the average lifespan has fallen from 48 in 1990 to 45 in 1997; infant mortality is 125 per 1 000 live births; one in eight babies dies in the first year; 4 000 women die in childbirth every year. We have problems that are no longer just a result of civil war but are due to famine, the weather, contaminated water, abysmal sanitation and desertification. Only between 10% and 20% of children, depending on the region, attend school. Women are abused. They have little, if any, educational opportunities. Nearly 100% female circumcision is practised. There is a lost generation of Somali professionals – doctors, teachers, civil servants – who fled the country before the war and have not returned. The worst of the crisis is in southern Somalia, in central areas such as Galcaio, which was devastated at the peak of the troubles and is now being rebuilt, even with street lighting being reinstalled.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget the progress that is being made in Somaliland: charity maternity hospitals are being built and opened, and there is a nurse training school. In Hargeisa unskilled wages are now twice the rate they are in Nairobi. In other words, political stability in some regions is bringing recovery and the hunger elsewhere is caused partly by fighting, although only sporadically, but much more by the drought. So our task must be to support aid and sustainable development projects and to look for political solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must support the transitional government. We must also remember that areas like Somaliland have voted twice now – in the 1960s and again in 2001 – in a referendum to have independence. That is their choice. They have elected governments. It shows that Somalia is a complex region. There are some areas of despair and desolation. There are also areas of regeneration and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to rescue the hungry and vulnerable, support moves to bring political stability, but also respect the various traditions of those five Somali nations so that they can come together through these conferences to live as neighbours in peace and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as support is concerned, the situation has been described objectively, albeit in the blackest terms, by all the honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the European Union is the biggest donor of development aid to Somalia and it has earmarked a further EUR 200 million for the period from 2002 to 2007. Plans to strengthen Somalia must naturally give priority to the social sector, especially education, as the members have said, given that it is the best way of dealing with extremism and terrorism. Of course there are huge demands as regards administrative capacities and aid distribution; this is one of the biggest challenges and the Commission needs to be flexible if it is to ensure that the money is distributed correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the last comment is concerned, on coordinating aid and intervention in Somalia, I have to say that, obviously, the European Union is working together with the United Nations, it is implementing some of its programmes and it is one of the founder members of the initiative to coordinate aid to Somalia set up in Nairobi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
