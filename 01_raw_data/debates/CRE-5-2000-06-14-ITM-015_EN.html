However, I am at a disadvantage. I was not involved in the work of the conciliation committee, although I have studied the documents. So please forgive me if I am not quite as well informed as the members who helped in the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank those members because, even as someone who was not involved, I can say that this is an important directive. It is important to SMEs, it is important to the public sector, it is probably a far more important instrument for promoting employment than many of the resolutions passed here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I can still remember the earlier debates: late payments are a breach of contract and this directive stipulates that the purchaser must pay the vendor the full sum owed within 30 days of receipt of the goods. Otherwise, he must pay a penalty in the form of interest etc. Discussions with the Council gave rise to a whole series of problems which we have now managed to settle, several sittings later. One of the main problems was the question of retention of title, whereby the vendor retains ownership of the goods pending full payment. It was also agreed that freedom of contract cannot be invoked in order to limit the effects of the so-called anti-abuse clause. We have agreed on a clear regulation here which ensures that the debtor cannot procure additional liquidity or additional advantages at the creditor’s expense.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition – and this was an important point – the principle of equal treatment between the public and private sectors has been acknowledged. As far as interest is concerned, we have compromised between the 6% proposed by Council and the 8% proposed by Parliament, agreeing in the conciliation procedure on 7%.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, it is a reasonable result and, I repeat, it is a result which will mainly help SMEs in the Union. I personally was most surprised to read that late payments were one of the main reasons for bankruptcies in Europe. Apparently some 450,000 jobs are lost in the EU every year as a result. We often spend a great deal of money on very few jobs. Here we are achieving the desired effect cost-free, as it were, and I think that Parliament should make it clear to the outside world that it has done job security a huge service.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close with one more comment regarding the Commission. Late payments are a breach of contract even when it is the Commission which is late paying. This does not figure in the directive but, in my experience as an MEP, we often hear complaints when we visit SMEs and large companies alike, that the Commission is often far too late honouring the payment commitments which it has entered into in research promotion or other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will be guided by the spirit of this directive and make its own payments on time, because here too, I repeat, this is breach of contract.</p>
<p class="contents">My warmest thanks once again to everyone involved and I hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I smiled and told him that I wished such a thing were possible, because it would be a relief to millions of SMEs, but that I thought it would be extremely difficult. I am pleased that we now have before us a directive making that wish come true.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard and we know what it costs SMEs, what it costs the European economy, what it costs workers when certain companies, which can and do throw their financial and purchasing weight around, or public sectors which can and do throw their weight around, acquire extra liquidity free of charge, at no cost to them, but at the expense, mainly, of SMEs. Approximately half a million workers lost their jobs and one in four companies went bust because bigger and stronger companies got away with not paying them on time.</p>
<p class="contents">Today marks the beginning of a new era, an era which will, of course, dawn in two years’ time, once this directive, which gives SMEs different prospects for a different future, has been transposed into national legislation. It gives them reason to believe that they too have the power to trade in a fair competitive environment, an environment which has been missing all these years, an environment which the SMEs of the European Union have been trying in vain to achieve. Have you any idea how soul-destroying it is when a small businessman, with limited access to bank loans, is expected to subsidise companies with a far bigger cash flow or the huge public sector of a country? It is a bitter pill to swallow.</p>
<p class="contents">What I can say is that the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council were a most pleasant experience. Of course, I can say now that it was a pleasant experience because the outcome has been extremely positive for Parliament. And it would be no exaggeration to say that Parliament was the institution of the European Union which understood exactly where the interests of European society and European business lie, which is why we used all our arguments and exerted all our pressure to persuade the Council that all the European Parliament’s proposed amendments went in the right direction. And, of course, I must thank the SMEs and Parliament and the Executive Commission, which also helped to achieve this result, and it is a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to close by saying that every SME in the European Union and millions of workers in small- and medium-sized commercial, handicraft and professional companies in the European Union will look towards us tomorrow, towards the plenary of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, in the belief that a new day has dawned for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that Mr Linkohr will pass on these congratulations to Mr Murphy. I would also like to thank the Commission for its cooperation, which has been as constructive as ever. We should be proud of the common text which we will be adopting tomorrow and which we were able to adopt in the Conciliation Committee. It is regulating what should be regulated. Nothing more, nothing less. It is also regulating matters to the extent that they need to be regulated at European level. Again, nothing more, nothing less. And it is regulating matters in a legally well-organised way. We can defend it perfectly from all angles, both with regard to transactions between traders and transactions between traders and the government. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as early as in 1993 – at the very outset of the internal market – we, together with Parliament, asked the Commission to submit a proposal to regulate late payments. Initially, the Commission’s reaction was low-key, in the form of a recommendation. It subsequently took a tougher line with a proposal for binding rules. It took all of us two years to make the political choices and to formulate them in a technically correct manner. We have now provided the framework; all that is left now is the transposition. The Member States have been given two years to do this in. Let us hope, together with the thousands of SMEs in whose interest it is for the Member States to respect the transposition period, that our Member States act more swiftly. In fact, let us encourage them to do so. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, a European Cup should go to the Member State which manages to finish its homework first. </p>
<p class="contents">I have another question for the Commission. I should like to have known whether it plans to formulate proposals on conditions for setting up debt-collecting agencies, which is one of the issues which we discussed for a long time in the course of the preliminary work but which we left out of this directive for a good reason. My question is whether the Commission is planning to make proposals in this respect at a later stage and, if so, when?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A good day’s work deserves a good day’s pay. But some have had to wait for it longer than others. The stronger the partner, the more power he has to make a business wait. Here, for the first time, we have a regulation which ensures that the company’s liquidity is secured once the service has been provided, and within a foreseeable period of time. I am delighted that we are debating today in the small circle, because you can see that this directive is totally uncontested and that the European Parliament stands fully behind this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that some 450,000 jobs are lost every year as the result of late payments. When we talk about job security and job creation, then we have a very important and crucial directive here which helps us to secure 450,000 jobs a year in Europe. That deserves the headlines in the press but, as you know, the fight for jobs is already taken for granted. I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is making such an important contribution to this. This initiative was intensively promoted to start with by Marianne Thyssen, Mr Folias and Mr Murphy and we are proud of such an excellent result in the House. Payment within 30 days, precautions to ensure that payments are actually made and that the company receives the money within 90 days. It is a sensational result. Congratulations! I am proud to be a member of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the esteemed Member, Mrs Thyssen, has said, this directive deals with what it can and must deal with, no more and no less. I believe that this is a magnificent definition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s initial proposal was much more ambitious, but since we are moving in that pioneer territory of the internal market – that territory which involves elements which are still the competence of the Member States such as procedural rules and civil law, ownership reservations, or Article 5 of the procedure for the recovery of non-contested debt etc…– the Commission’s proposal was not in accordance with the Treaty, since we lacked a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal is less complete, if you like, but no less effective. I believe that it will have significant repercussions, which have been listed by previous speakers. Above all, I am going to highlight one more, and that is that it opens up the road to seriously dealing with the need to fully enter into this pioneer territory. This is because, today, there are still genuine obstacles to the perfection of the internal market, genuine obstacles to the four freedoms laid down in the Treaty, precisely because we do not have a clear legal basis. Now, with the Treaty of Amsterdam, we may have a clearer legal basis, but we must make a great effort to establish effective coordination and harmonisation in all of these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will affect millions of small businesses and millions of individuals who carry on economic activities, even though this may not as yet be apparent. In my opinion, the forecast, as it was established at the end of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, is precise and essentially correct. A balance has been found which will certainly influence the relations between buyers and sellers significantly. It is a measure which facilitates the market, not one which places restrictions on it, although it does lay down rules – for rules are sometimes essential in order to maintain the free market – and it is therefore a positive preventive action which essentially protects the weakest: both those who are weakest financially and those who are weakest socially.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some areas of Europe – including certain areas of Italy, for example – where a very successful company has a substantial, decisive, unambiguous influence on the market, which almost amounts to a monopoly. Clearly, this company influences not only prices but also time frames, including settlement periods. This is sometimes negative for those who need to work and are forced to have recourse to this company.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is that of equal conditions for public and private industry, which I see as a positive thing and which will affect, or, rather, will be a positive development for public accounts. In fact, you will be aware that public companies settle within a certain period, and this time limit means that it will no longer be possible for private companies who deal with the public sector to impose large, excessive burdens on public companies. Consequently, public expenditure will also be reduced.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an issue which is seemingly unimportant but which in fact affects several million companies – I myself am a small businessman – and tens of millions of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a proverb in Italian: <span class="italic">Non e mai troppo tarde –</span> it is never too late! But it is too late for many small and medium-sized enterprises, family businesses and young entrepreneurs. And many companies will not survive the delay before what we will hopefully decide by a large majority tomorrow is actually transposed into law. Unfortunately they will no longer be able to take a positive view, as entrepreneurs, of this positive step in the right direction. It will help SMEs, bring greater legal certainty and improve property rights; in the final analysis it is an employment programme, providing help for young enterprises and family businesses but also protection for the consumer. I think that this aspect cannot be stressed enough.</p>
<p class="contents">All that is left is for me to thank all those involved, who have striven over the years to achieve this result. I hope that the intended beneficiaries will indeed be able to reap the benefits of it as quickly as possible.</p>

The tough negotiations, as good negotiations always are, have made the adoption of this directive possible. I am convinced, and several speakers have underlined this, that this is a particularly important directive for European businesses as it affects all commercial transactions between these businesses and between authorities, in both the public and private sector. In saying this I believe I have responded to a comment made by Mr Linkohr.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope and we are convinced that the directive will have a positive impact on the daily commercial transactions of all businesses, whether these are large multinationals or small and medium-sized undertakings. However, it is only right to point out that this type of directive is essentially intended for small and medium-sized undertakings because, given the operating rules of the market, it is these which will gain the most positive benefits from the effectiveness of the directive on late payments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we have therefore adopted a legal framework which is simultaneously serious, rigorous and effective. The Commission will do everything in its power not only to guarantee the appropriate transposition of this directive into national law during the next two years but also to reassess the late payment situation in the future in view of the actual application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I must conclude by again congratulating Mr Murphy and this House on the decision to be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
