<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmitt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Amsterdam has at last paved the way for joint action in the area of asylum law and refugee and immigration policy. In my view, this was long overdue, because the decision to move from a purely economic community to political union was taken a long time ago. That the Treaty of Amsterdam moved in this direction was therefore all the more important. Unfortunately, when it happened, Parliament was only granted the right to be consulted on moves in the relevant legal areas, which is why I expressly state here that I trust that the Commission will continue to ensure that Parliament remains fully involved, despite the fact that it only has a right of consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, one thing must be made clear: given that, officially, we only have the right to be consulted, we shall only have any effective influence on the Commission and on how the relevant legal provisions develop if we, as a Parliament, agree on common principles and waive the need for full implementation of individual political goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we have chosen a good approach to this issue over recent months during our discussions of the Commission’s working paper. I know from my own group, I must add, that, because of how the report is drafted, the view of hardly anyone here in the House is wholly represented. That is precisely what happens when you make compromises and try to find a consensus. You are satisfied on many points, but not always 100%.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to highlight the main points which I think are important for future asylum procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">First: we must summon up the courage to separate the three main groups, i.e. asylum, on the one hand, and the temporary admission of refugees from crisis regions and immigration policy, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: we must ensure that qualification procedures are shortened and simplified, without sacrificing sufficiently high standards of careful examination.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: our aim must be to allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum just once within the European Union. However, this means ensuring the same procedural law applies everywhere and is applied uniformly. This means training officials in charge of processing applications to a high standard. These officials must have access to cross-border information. And we must also ensure that asylum seekers are treated in exactly the same way, wherever they make their application. This includes welfare, accommodation etc. We need to guarantee that, in theory, you will face the same procedure everywhere, irrespective of whether you make your application in Spain, Germany or England. If we can guarantee that, then inversely, it is only logical to rule that just one application is allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: I think that the Member States of the EU should be required to draw up a uniform, binding list of countries subject to a visa requirement and safe third countries and countries of origin. I know that some people are critical of this. But, in my view, it is the only way to ensure that officials take decisions on the basis of the same criteria and to create legal certainty for applicants in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point which I should like to address, and which we have made clear several times in the report, is that the burden must be divided between the Member States. How exactly this burden will be divided obviously still needs to be discussed. But one thing is clear: the door on which the majority of asylum seekers or refugees knocks cannot be left to chance. One country alone should not have to bear the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that asylum law is a difficult and politically sensitive issue but I think that we have made a start in the discussions in committee over recent months. We have discussed extremely constructively and fairly with each other. This discussion has encouraged me and I am convinced that Parliament is now in a position to give its joint support to the continuing legislative process and, possibly, to discuss other difficult issues, such as an immigration law, constructively.</p>

He speaks from the heart. Common principles were indeed seen as more important than individual political objectives. I should also like briefly to thank my committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs, for the confidence which it placed in a neo-parliamentarian, someone who has just climbed on board, in entrusting me with this sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to asylum is enshrined in various treaties but, because of different definitions and interpretations by national courts, the law is applied to differing degrees. This obviously contradicts the principles and objectives of the EC Treaty, Title 4 of which refers to asylum policy as an important means of establishing an area of peace, security and justice. Establishing a uniform asylum law and harmonised implementing provisions is therefore a Community objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The document presented by the Commission starts by explaining that legally binding instruments need to be adopted for the asylum procedure. Eight specific points are dealt with: Communitisation of the Dublin system, EURODAC, minimum standards for admission, minimum standards for recognising refugees, minimum standards for granting or withdrawing refugee status, complementary, subsidiary protection, temporary protection for displaced persons and, last but not least, a division of the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs has also achieved a consensus which pleases me greatly; here too individual political objectives had to be put aside and we drafted a good opinion which was useful for Mr Schmitt’s report. I think that we shall have a highly constructive vote in favour of our common ideal tomorrow. I wish us all the courage and strength to push forward on the final point which you addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the working document presented by the Commission, which was the starting point for the report. It is a sound basis for instituting a debate which should culminate at some point in a legal act setting out common standards for an asylum procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the report, which I particularly wish to highlight, because the rapporteur really has succeeded in finding a broad consensus right across the political divide on a very delicate matter. That is no easy task and we have all experienced quite the opposite here, which is why this is an excellent piece of work. I should like to pick up on three points which I think are particularly important and which I would ask the Commission to take into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the question of how to divide the burden and has already been addressed. We must not concentrate on just one aspect; we need to remain receptive to a distribution in terms of people. If you look at refugee movements, you will see that they always affect the same countries. Austria, for example, where I come from, is always near the top of the list when it comes to admitting temporary refugees or asylum seekers. It is on a par with Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Others have a much lighter burden to bear and greater solidarity between the Member States is needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight the question of shortening and simplifying the qualification procedures without – and that is the crux of the matter – compromising careful examination. It is an important point, because asylum seekers are entitled to a fast decision and a fast answer on their future status.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that which gives legal certainty and which, when implemented, helps to ensure that identical decisions are taken in all Member States. It is the point which requires us to keep up-to-date lists of safe third countries and countries of origin. It will help enormously if we manage to draw up these lists. It attracted a broad consensus but I fear that this consensus will not perhaps hold up if all the amendments proposed by the Greens are included. They want much that is positive, but they want a lot that is total, as Mrs Merkel once remarked. If, for example, they want to implement the total extension of the definition of refugee or total access for asylum seekers to the job market or work to reverse the burden of proof, then the consensus achieved with their vote in committee will be jeopardised. I call on them to consider withdrawing these proposed amendments so that the broad consensus can be maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Pirker has addressed an important aspect of the debate now behind us, namely the fact that this was the first time we have held a debate over several months in a political field in which, for as long as I have been here in Parliament, we have only ever become entrenched, which was marked by a willingness all round to compromise and, more importantly, by the ability all round to compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me say straight away that you, Mr Schmitt, have carried out what I see as an exemplary piece of work. We always extend our ritual thanks to the rapporteur but, in this case, I should like to do so in a special way, by saying that you have astounded all of us sitting on the left side of this House. The Secretary-General of the Berlin CDU, an important regional branch of the Christian-Democrat Union in Germany, has quite clearly stated in the report submitted here, and which bears his name, that he is in favour of maintaining the individual’s right to asylum as a fundamental right. As a German Social Democrat, all I can say is well done! Your party leadership in Berlin – I mean the federal, not the local leadership – maintains exactly the opposite, namely that an immigration law is needed and that the individual right to claim protection is therefore no longer needed. Assert yourself in your party. I guarantee that you will have the support of the German Social Democrats, if no-one else.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from what Mr Pirker has said that you have obviously been engaged in real missionary work in your group; but good works deserve to be praised. What we have achieved – and Mr Pirker has indicated that he is ready to vote in favour – is a report which addresses the standards which need to be applied to the asylum procedure so that comparable conditions and requirements for applying for and claiming asylum can be created uniformly throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of standards, we mean formal processes, procedural processes and we must do our best, in doing so, to guard against loading them with ideological connotations or questions of principle of a long-term, political nature. That is one of the reasons why we are telling our fellow members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that we reject all their proposed amendments except one. This one amendment deals with remand pending deportation, which we too feel is an instrument worth examining. I am not judging that. We shall reject your proposed amendments because we need to learn in this Parliament, as legislators, that we should and must deal in the legislative process with the subject matter which needs to inform the law. But here we are talking about the procedural, not the substantive right to asylum. That is something else entirely. The Greens’ proposed amendments contain a discussion of the content, not the form of asylum law.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will certainly have noticed, we in the Socialist group have not filed any more proposed amendments to plenary; nor do we need to because the Schmitt report as voted by the committee corresponds in a very large measure to what we, as Socialists, have in mind: the fundamental vested right guaranteeing everyone who wishes to use it access to the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to us to have a guarantee of legal support in the procedure in a form which ensures above all – and we consider this to be tremendous progress – that those involved in the procedure are dealt with in a language which they can understand, i.e. that they are given the support they need to understand the procedure, that they can claim legal counsel in every case, that they can appeal to the court against the initial administrative decision and, as the most decisive point for us – I would remind my German fellow members of the debate within Germany – that this appeal has a suspensive effect. That is a huge step forward for us. It also means – and we went into this in considerable detail in our contribution to the debate in committee – that, where the applicant has temporary leave to stay during the appeal procedure, this procedure cannot take years; on the contrary, there must be a fast-track procedure, because the public and the applicant both have a right to swift completion of the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, Mr Schmitt has submitted a report which we in the group of the Party of European Socialists can support and I am fairly certain that this report will get what it deserves, i.e. a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, fellow members. A word on a personal note: Today is the last sitting in which I shall act as coordinator of the group of the Party of European Socialists. I shall soon be devoting myself to different tasks in my group. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to thank all my fellow members, Mr Wiebenga, Mr Pirker, Mr Ceyhun and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, with whom I have worked so closely in this capacity over recent years, for always cooperating with me so fairly and trustingly.</p>

It is unfortunate, but we wish you all the best in your new job. This was the fun part of what I wanted to say. </p>
<p class="contents">What shape is the European asylum policy in? That is hard to say, as there is not really a European asylum policy to speak of. We in this Parliament, the delegates as well as their predecessors, have for years been pushing in the right direction. So far, the European Commission, that is to say the present Commissioner’s predecessor, failed to come up with the goods but, prior to the Treaty of Amsterdam, had little say in the matter anyway. The previous European Commission may have had the will, but did not have any power. The bottleneck, as we quite often noticed, was located within the Council of Ministers. Most governments showed willing too, but they were subject to the rule of unanimity. Then there was the Tampere Summit. Dozens of proposals were submitted there, also in this area of policy. Things were looking up, according to many journalists. They had, however, overlooked the fact that the crippling policy of decision-making on the basis of unanimity still applied. It is unlikely that a scoreboard will be able to unlock this paralysis within policy. All it will do is make it clear to the outside world which body and country are responsible for the paralysis within policy. </p>
<p class="contents">What needs to happen now? All sorts of things need to happen. As far as we, the Liberal group, are concerned, both the European Commission’s working document and Mr Schmitt’s report, which we are discussing today, are a useful leg-up to the next phase and, in our opinion, and I would echo the opinions of previous speakers, Mr Schmitt has adopted a level-headed approach in his report. We will be voting in favour of the tenor of the report and we are backing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiatives of the European Union on reuniting families, the anti-discrimination package, temporary protection for war refugees and, at long last, the attempt to harmonise asylum law make this very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, with the Schmitt report – for which, by the way, I thank you in my capacity as coordinator of the Greens – we have the first clear stand by the European Parliament, even if a number of sensible proposed amendments – our proposals, which are also recommended by the UNHCR – have been rejected. Mr Pirker, I do not see a problem with this – you can reject them again tomorrow. One way or another, we shall be voting in favour of Mr Schmitt’s report. These are the usual parliamentary rules of play and with them we can all live happily under one roof – that is my assumption.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Tempus fugit</span>! We must implement the Treaty of Amsterdam by the end of 2004. There are difficulties at hand though. The national states are often not prepared as yet to support European rules. But this should not divert us from our purpose. Mr Schmitt’s report goes in the right direction and calls on the Commission to take specific steps by proposing legislation. I hope that we will be able to persuade the Member States of the merits of our approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is necessary not only for legal and administrative reasons but also and especially in order to uphold the dignity of asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear, well-defined rules governing the matter are also necessary in order to avoid the right to asylum being confused with the problem of immigration. I used the word ‘problem’ intentionally, for the very reason that the absence of an adequate immigration policy has meant that our citizens often perceive all forms of immigration as a problem, a burden and even a hazard, instead of as a social and economic resource and a source of cultural enrichment.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, for example, unregulated or, even worse, illegal immigration is related to organised crime. In this confusion where illegal activity is ever increasing there are no rules and no certainties. In particular, the human rights of neither European citizens nor immigrants are genuinely being upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore urgent for us to define an immigration policy, and therefore also a reception policy and a migration flow control policy, a policy which takes into practical account the genuine existence of social phenomena and which refuses to be conditioned by ideologies. This is the framework within which the right to asylum must take its place: it is a sacrosanct right which every self-respecting civil society must uphold.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a leap forward in the development of the Union, and that is what is behind my wishing to remind you of a simple fact, namely that the root cause of the asylum problem is social breakdown in countries in the vicinity of the EU. East, and especially south, of the EU’s borders, an increasing majority of people live in a sea of social destitution and political oppression, and it is that which triggers the asylum problem. The EU is the region’s superpower – economically, politically and militarily. Political breakdown in neighbouring countries in the Balkans and in North Africa is the EU’s responsibility. It is not just a question of passivity and sins of omission. It is a question of the EU and the Member States having, by virtue of economic hegemony, political dominance and military power, contributed actively to the forms of social breakdown that turn our fellow human beings into refugees. Do the EU’s institutions and Member States now want to change these basic conditions? No, for these are the EU’s very rationale. Is the main message of the Commission’s working document and of the report we have before us that there is a willingness to do something about the core problem? No. Nor are Christian love of neighbour and human solicitude, or even just general decency, the pivotal factors. This document is another building block – and an important one – in that Fortress Europe we are constructing with all the means at our disposal to keep our wretched neighbours out in the cold. It is not a question of our being obliged to guarantee legal rights to our fellow human beings. Rather, we ought to be exercising justice in the sense of sharing the burden fairly, with the rich countries giving in accordance with their abilities. We should not regard refugees as interested parties. Moreover, the flow of refugees is limited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say to you, Mr Schulz, from the bottom of my heart, something which I would like somebody one day to say about me: you have been a good adversary, that is to say, a hard adversary, always frank, forceful, often discomforting and there is no doubt that we will miss you.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me now to come to the point and say that this seems to me to be an important Commission document because it genuinely launches a debate which many previous documents pointed to, in particular the Tampere conclusions, but the content of which needed to be clarified. There is, without doubt, a great need to clarify the existing differences between the asylum procedure, reception conditions, the interpretation of the definition of a refugee, the links between that asylum procedure and the ‘Dublin mechanism’ procedures and other forms of protection and, in this respect, this document perfectly focuses the debate. I am not going to mention all of the points highlighted by the other speakers, but I would like to insist on two points in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe that the Commission correctly relates the issues concerning asylum procedures, the object of a future directive, to the Dublin Convention procedure and the notion of a safe third country. I must say in this regard that I have put forward an amendment which is against the system of lists. It is problem of method. Fiji was a secure country until a few days ago, and overnight it ceased to be one. If we employ a system of closed lists, difficulties will arise in terms of keeping the lists up to date, which would cause enormous harm.</p>
<p class="contents">The other amendment which I have signed concerns the distribution of burdens. We are all aware that the principle of solidarity requires a distribution of the consequences stemming from the current asymmetry in requests for asylum. Firstly, we must say that if we achieve harmonised asylum procedures, the level of requests will also tend to become more homogenised. Secondly, I would like to say that this report has one virtue which I would like to highlight amongst others – although I have been critical on some points – and that is that it very much insists on legal certainty, on judicial safeguards, on the asylum seeker’s right to defence and, in particular, on everything contained in point 4 and, of course, on everything relating to legal assistance, with the possibility of making contact with NGOs and the UNHCR.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, this fits in very badly with the measures on distribution by quotas which have an image which is closely connected to deportation. Therefore, Mr President, I hope that certain groups, and in particular the PPE Group, will reconsider this amendment, which takes up the amendment of the Group of the Greens precisely. In other words, it is not an amendment of a conservative or any other origin, nor of any particular geographical origin. It takes up an amendment of the Group of the Greens which was not approved in committee and I believe it should receive the support of the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps you are right to attack us, Mr Pirker, when we think slightly beyond what is planned here in this document. For example, with regard to access to the labour market. However, a fellow member in your group, if I remember correctly, our new Home Secretary, expressed a similar thought once. We are also concerned here about the independence of asylum seekers and about social realities. Mr Schulz has reproached us Greens on the same count.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, perhaps you are right, but if we are talking about the individual right to asylum, then this also implies that there must be an individual examination in special cases. That also forms part of the legal framework. We cannot just evince an interest in what happens within the EU and consider that we have nothing more to do with what becomes of an applicant outside the EU. It is no longer our sovereign territory, which is why this one proposed amendment is highly important and significant, precisely in order to ensure that there is no risk of persecution in the land of origin for rejected asylum seekers present on EU sovereign territory and that asylum seekers enjoy effective protection against <span class="italic">refoulement </span>in the third country to which they are deported. That is the responsibility which we simply wish to accept in engaging in this debate, a debate which – and here you are right – needs further discussion and needs to be examined in much, much greater detail. We have made a start, a good start and must progress hand in hand. I shall be pleased if we progress by so much as a millimetre.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disappearance of internal borders and the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice require us to make an effort to harmonise our asylum and immigration policies and to reinforce checks at external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, if we are to address this problem seriously we must establish a clear distinction between the entry of asylum-seekers, within the meaning of the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees, the entry of migrants for economic or other reasons and the temporary reception of refugees from regions in crisis. These are all different situations which must be treated differently.</p>
<p class="contents">The applications for asylum are not distributed evenly, as Mr Pirker pointed out. There is clearly a disproportion in the number of asylum applications being recorded in each Member State. This disproportion is bad for the European Union as a whole because it creates inequalities between Member States. The procedures for granting legal refugee status and the conditions for assessing applications must therefore be harmonised so that these are equivalent in terms of the level of protection of asylum-seekers. A cost-sharing policy must also be established. Solidarity must be for all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that common rules are adopted on the reception of asylum-seekers, on the requirements to be met in order to obtain refugee status and on the process of granting or refusing this status. In particular these rules must prevent asylum applications being made simultaneously in several Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the next four years will be better and more fruitful for all of us. I would, however, say that we have started our second year of parliamentary activity on an upbeat by discussing and – tomorrow, I believe – adopting this major initiative on the definition of common standards on asylum procedures. There is nothing more European than this, and I therefore welcome Mr Schmitt’s report. I support the report and agree with every word it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">A pensioner who, as a member of the Pensioners’ Party, always comes to see me off at Bergamo airport when I come to Strasbourg, said to me: “Yes, I agree. Exiles should be granted asylum. It is right for refugees and those who have been persecuted who have to flee from their own land to be granted asylum, but I live on ITL 700 000 a month which is a day and a half of your travel allowance. Who is going to help me? I would be willing to help and even accommodate asylum seekers.” And I replied, “Do not worry. You will see that the Commission will also use those who do not have work who are admitted into our country to help elderly people who are not self-sufficient and who need help.”</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, I would argue that it is right for the burden of providing asylum to be divided, at last, between all 15 Member States of the European Union. I hope that the Commission will bring this about, starting with the events in Kosovo, so that the States which bore the brunt of providing asylum for Kosovars will be reimbursed by all the other States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sense of consensus is to be welcomed. It is a good working document and we have a good basis to start working, so I congratulate the Commission as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel slightly uncomfortable, given that Ireland is the home of the Dublin Convention and has only very recently begun to receive an appreciable number of refugees and asylum seekers, that unfortunately, the Dublin Convention is not working terribly well. About 85% of the people arriving in Ireland have not been stopped at the original port of call or processed in the country in which they originally arrived in the Community. While I can fully appreciate and have great sympathy with the concerns of colleagues calling for burden-sharing, there is a fairly large amount of informal burden-sharing going on anyway. Reception countries are happily turning a blind eye to the people passing through their countries on the way to third countries. Having said that, I believe very strongly that we need to harmonise legal procedures so that we can offer a safe haven to those many people seeking refuge in the Community and also so as to have a humane and caring reception procedure that is uniform throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the work I have been doing in this particular area I am very concerned about the criminal activities of some asylum seekers who are exploiting members of their own communities, through trafficking in women and young people. Cooperation between police forces, where there is widespread information on prostitution amongst young girls in the Member States, has unfortunately to be an intrinsic part of our asylum policy. What is clear, particularly in my own country at the moment, is that we must challenge the alarming rise in racism and xenophobia within our communities. It is a deeply disturbing phenomenon in my own country. We need clear implementation of good, humane laws and we will all benefit from them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has now received reactions on this working document from several Member States, from numerous NGOs, and with the report of Parliament, will be in a position to fulfil one of the commitments of the scoreboard, which is to present a directive on minimum standards for asylum procedures. It is my intention to present this proposal for a directive in the autumn of 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind the House that the Commission proposed to the Tampere European Council to adopt a single European asylum system. But the decision of the European Council in Tampere was to endorse an approach based on minimum common standards. So the directive is, in my opinion, the most relevant instrument to address these minimum standards for asylum procedures which will have to reflect the cornerstones of the policy of the European Union with regard to asylum as was underscored by the European Council in Tampere: an absolute respect for the right to seek asylum, a full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and maintaining the principle of non-refoulement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the approach the European Parliament has taken in many parts of the motion for a resolution. The Commission endorses the recital calling for asylum policy to be conducted on as factual a basis as possible. We fully agree with Parliament that common standards of asylum procedures should not be based solely on the premise that administrative and judicial activities have to be expedited but should likewise be informed by the need to preserve the dignity of asylum seekers. We have to recognise that finding a balanced solution between simplifying the procedures on the one hand and guaranteeing legal certainty and respect for the rights of asylum seekers on the other hand is not an easy task. But we are determined to come up with a solution that can be considered with a broad consensus as a balanced solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that entry of asylum seekers, migration for economic or other reasons and temporary admittance of displaced persons and refugees in the event of a mass influx must be treated as entirely separate matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution calls for temporary protection within three years. On 24 May 2000 the Commission adopted a directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of effort between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already sent such a proposal for consultation with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that this proposal on temporary protection addresses explicitly the question raised by several speakers on burden-sharing as we have adopted an approach on burden-sharing on the proposal we have already submitted to the Council for a European fund for refugees. So I should like to stress that this proposal cannot be seen as separate from the other proposals that are already on the table and that they take into account the sensitive question of solidarity among Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind the House that with regard to asylum, the scoreboard that has been submitted reflects the conclusions at the Tampere Summit where a two-stage approach was adopted by the Heads of State and Government. The first step consists of harmonising standards relating to asylum and protection, and the second step is the introduction of a common asylum procedure as such. To achieve the first step, the Commission will not only come up with a proposal for a directive on common standards for fair and efficient asylum procedures, which we are now discussing, but will also bring forward, inter alia and as soon as possible, proposals on the determination of the state responsible for the examination of an application and on common minimum conditions for reception of asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind the House that, as I have already said, we have already put forward for consultation by Member States a working document that aims to replace the Dublin Convention by a Community regulation, having in mind the concrete experience and the vulnerabilities and deficiencies that have arisen in the application of the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second step, the Tampere conclusions invited the Commission to come forward with a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those who are granted asylum valid throughout the Union. It is my intention that by the end of the year 2000 this communication will be brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes – as has been emphasised by several speakers – that the European Parliament has taken a general position on rationalising Community law on asylum matters in this resolution. The Commission will not only study the resolution very carefully in order to prepare its proposal for a directive on common standards on asylum procedures – that I reiterate will be presented in the autumn of this year – but will also reflect on them whilst preparing the communication it will put forward by the end of this year on a common asylum procedure in the long term. I sincerely feel encouraged by the fact that this communication has such broad support in the House. With such commitment, both from the Commission and Parliament, I sincerely hope we will succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
