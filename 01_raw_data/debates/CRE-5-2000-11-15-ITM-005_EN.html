A small subject grew into an extensive piece of work owing to the fact that proposals on hazardous and non-hazardous waste were combined in a single directive. My suggestion that we should include them in one directive was supported by the then President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Trittin, and by the Commission, which meant that Parliament’s motion to amalgamate three directives did not meet with a great deal of opposition. The amalgamation had the effect of streamlining Community legislation. Things did not go as swimmingly for Parliament’s amendments from first reading, as the Council rejected most of them.</p>
<p class="contents">A chastened Parliament confined itself to adopting sixteen amendments at second reading. The need for conciliation soon became apparent because, as it turned out, the Council was not minded to adopt these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid a costly and exacting official conciliation procedure, informal negotiations were opened in order to see if a compromise could be reached. However, Parliament’s willingness to expedite the procedure demanded flexibility on the part of the Council. That proved to be a sticking point on account of the divergent positions. Ultimately, after some tough negotiating, an outcome was achieved that is worth defending. As rapporteur, I do so with utter conviction. Throughout the entire period, I was able to work well together with the representatives of the Council and the Commission, and was secure in the knowledge that I had the support of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and its secretariat. I would like to sincerely thank all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, just one more time, to give three reasons as to why the directive on waste incineration is so important. Firstly, the emission of dioxins, as well as the emission of other harmful substances will be drastically reduced. Secondly, the public will have far better access to information about incineration plants. Thirdly, it will substantially reduce the disparity between the requirements governing incineration plants and those governing plants for the co-incineration of waste, such as cement kilns.</p>
<p class="contents">But although I am upbeat about the outcome of this directive, it cannot conceal the fact that waste incineration is an emergency solution. After all, we have not managed to avoid the production of waste, nor have we succeeded in introducing recycling. Fortunately, there is talk of progress on the technological front, where the emphasis must be on sustainability. I will give you an example: PVC comprises 0.7% of the total amount of incinerated waste. According to the Commission’s Green Paper, incinerating PVC waste gives rise to a number of problems. We must get straight down to tackling these problems, leaving no stone unturned. Sustainable technology could prove helpful to us in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I anticipate our being able to tighten up the waste incineration directive in a few years’ time, in close consultation with industry. The people who live in the vicinity of these plants will thank us for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The urgency of this subject is made more acutely felt by the problem of animal meal in feedingstuffs, which we are going to be debating later this afternoon, which are going to have to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this proposal, which aims to replace three directives relating to waste incineration, is to improve air, water and soil quality and human health by reducing emissions of pollutants linked to incineration and co-incineration, notably dioxins, furans and heavy metals. This proposal also allows for the integration of the technical progress that has been achieved since the 1990s. Overall, the result of the conciliation process is very pleasing.</p>
<p class="contents">The emission limit values for incineration and co-incineration plants have been brought into line, while taking account of the technical differences between these two activities. I have always been in agreement with the joint draft which regards these two systems as complementary and not competing. Today, we cannot do without either of these incineration methods. Yet one can only regret the fusion of these incineration processes in terms of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, which has considerably complicated the debate, and which I have always condemned. In my view, the working method is not good, and I believe it is undesirable that we behave in this manner on such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we are satisfied with this third reading, because it reinforces the operation authorisation conditions. Our group, which wanted to avoid the confusion between hazardous and non-hazardous waste, recognises that the current text clearly provides for different recovery and treatment processes, which are adapted to the types of waste involved. Supplementary precautions will have to be taken as far as hazardous waste is concerned. Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that the Group of the Europe People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is satisfied by the work that has been carried out during the course of the third reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that it has been a long and very difficult process putting together the requirements for the incineration of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. I want to draw attention to just three important objectives we can achieve by means of the directive. First and foremost, a significant contribution has now been made to reducing discharges of hazardous and polluting substances produced by incineration – substances which are very harmful to people’s health and which damage the environment. This is to happen by means of the operational requirements made in connection with incineration plant and also by means of the emission limit values we have now established for heavy metals, dioxins and other substances. I also think, however, that it is very important to emphasise that it is now no longer merely a question of discharges into the atmosphere but also of discharges into the water and the earth.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to point out is that, as Mr Blokland too mentioned, people are now to be given more information about emissions from incineration plant in the form of the annual reports that are to be prepared. I think this is a very important result. People are entitled to be told about these things. Finally, I want to emphasise that, by establishing the common requirements which everyone must now fulfil, we can presumably get rid of a significant proportion of so-called waste tourism. It will no longer be so financially attractive to export waste to other places in the Community where waste handling requirements are less strict. As Mr Blokland mentioned, incineration is, of course, far from being the ideal way of disposing of waste. It is important for us to continually invest in better production methods, recycling and re-use. This ought clearly to be given priority ahead of incineration. It is nonetheless good that we have now obtained tighter rules covering waste incineration. I believe this will prove to be a significant contribution to improving the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a difficult process drafting the directive, as circumstances and practices in the Member States vary, and this affects many different interest groups. The end result is that we now have a reasonably balanced proposal for imposing strict limits regarding the incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, improving the environment and enabling waste to also be used in the production of electricity and heat.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the hardest problems was to define what co-incineration meant. In some countries the best alternative, environmentally speaking, is that carefully sorted combustible waste can be burned in small municipal plants that produce electricity and heating. In the first draft sketches for these plants there was a call for unnecessary, technically costly and, in some respects, impossible tests. The proposal has improved during the debate. It is also important that industry can still use non-hazardous waste in its own production of energy. In my opinion, the problem was also that the directive went into precise technical detail which it was hard to get unambiguous opinions on from the experts. I think we in Parliament should keep to the definition of the main arguments, allowing Member States to take account of differing circumstances and continue with best practice with regard to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">A directive on the incineration of waste will increase the costs of burning waste, but will cut hazardous emissions and improve the state of the environment. Our parliamentary debate achieved a reasonably balanced proposal that can serve as a basis for action throughout the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the toughening of legislation on landfill there has been significant increase in waste incineration, and I know from my own experience in my constituency in Wales that incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is as much a concern, in terms of its effects on health and the environment, as is landfill.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we do not replace one unhealthy and unsustainable form of waste disposal with another. Incineration is not recycling. It is not a clean and safe method of waste disposal. Genuinely sustainable alternatives must be funded and promoted and far more must be invested in research and in developing waste prevention, re-use and recycling. That is why I welcome these standards for co-incineration of municipal waste and the transportation of waste, which should help bring an end to the present trade in waste where areas with the cheapest operators and the lowest standards become the co-incineration capitals of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I welcome the commitment to improving public access to information on incineration plants and the obligation on plant operators to publish an annual report on emissions. Greater openness is obviously of major concern to people who live near these incinerators, but it will also help to ensure that the plant operators themselves keep below the emission ceilings that have been set.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of much stricter nitrogen oxide limits for new co-incineration plants such as cement kilns is also a step forward which will be an incentive for reducing emissions even though the standards proposed do not reflect the best available techniques. Overall, this much needed legislation will put in place safeguards to limit the worst effects of incineration on health and the environment and, I hope, discourage incineration-for-profit, which depends on the creation of more and more waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Agreement on the derogations in the scope of the directive was one of the hardest questions in the debate and conciliation process. The aim was for strictly limited derogations and the clearest possible definitions. In my opinion this has been successful, meaning that ecological targets and compatibility with other Community policies can come about in what is actually an easily realisable way. Parliament was also pushing for greater transparency and better opportunities for the public to have access to information. Thus, in the conciliation process we were able to agree that plants that incinerate more than two tons per hour should publish a report on their emissions each year and smaller incineration plants should be included in the lists that would come under public scrutiny. The limit values for emissions in the annex to the directive were definitely the most difficult point. In this respect the conciliation process achieved a good result, as Parliament’s proposal for stricter nitrogen oxide emissions in all new cement kilns co-incinerating waste was approved. I myself succeeded in having some amendments made to the report, vital for the continuation of co-incineration practices that have been in place in Finland for years and which are more ecological than those contained in the directive that is now about to be approved. I am very happy about that, as the job I had as a new member having come directly to the second reading was not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Blokland, now at its third reading, was for many members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, elected to Parliament for the first time, the first real test of learning with regard to parliamentary practice. The procedures chosen by the institutions work surprisingly well, however. The end result can be considered good, and with good reason. The important element in all this, though, was the genuine desire for cooperation on the part of the three institutions. The work of the countries to hold the presidency, Portugal and France, was constructive, and we have to mention in particular the role of the Commission, which played a decisive part in bringing about a satisfactory end result. In my opinion, there is something to be learnt from this for the future and we must see to it that cooperation to achieve a more ecological European Union works.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could not hear your introduction, but I can guess what was in it. First of all, I want to thank you for your excellent work as rapporteur on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that this directive has passed through the legislative procedure so smoothly serves to show how important it is for all concerned. This directive will lead to significant reductions in emissions in several key pollutants across the European Union, despite the fact that the volume of waste incineration will increase over the coming years. Not only does it contribute to the fight against air pollution but it also covers the release of waste water, as Mr Lund has said, from exhaust gas cleaning and the quality of waste from the incineration process itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation process was demanding, but a well-balanced compromise has been found and the amendments of Parliament and the Council have produced a better directive. The scope of the directive is much clearer. Public access to information has improved. Stricter emission-limit values have been introduced for new cement kilns that co-incinerate waste, as Mrs Evans pointed out. This has been largely due to the excellent work of the European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Blokland.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the joint text strikes the right balance – a view reflected in your speeches yesterday – incorporating a high level of environmental protection along with the legitimate interests of all stake holders. Let me remind you that the directive is only one instrument in the whole waste-management concept of the Commission. Burning waste is the final stage in the treatment of waste, due to the waste hierarchy, and the Commission will make strong efforts to reduce and recycle waste and in its approach to an integrated product policy. Of course, the overall objective is to prevent waste in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to the reduction of negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
