<p class="contents">To begin with, I would like to update you on the opinion adopted unanimously by the Scientific Steering Committee last Friday. This opinion was on the scientific grounds of the advice of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) regarding the measures applicable to British beef exports.</p>
<p class="contents">I arranged for the summary recommendations of the committee’s opinion to be issued to Parliament on Friday together with a copy of my statement to the press. Yesterday, I also arranged for the full copy of the report to be issued to you. However, you may not all have had time to digest their contents and I will, therefore, briefly summarise the main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion addressed in particular three questions from the Commission. These questions can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">- Is there any new evidence in the documentation provided by AFSSA?</p>
<p class="contents">- Is there a need to re-examine any of the four Scientific Steering Committee opinions directly related to the scientific rationale of the date-based export scheme?</p>
<p class="contents">- Is the date-based export scheme satisfactory with regard to the safety of meat and meat products concerned?</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion, the scientific steering committee confirmed that there is no need to review the decision to lift the ban on UK beef exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to quote three of the more important conclusions of the committee:</p>
<p class="contents">- “there is clear evidence of the continuing progressive decline in 1999 of BSE in the UK. There is no justification at present to infer any new route of infection”;</p>
<p class="contents">- “the SSC concludes that there are currently no grounds for revising the overall conclusions of the SSC opinions directly related to the rationale of the DBES”; and, finally:</p>
<p class="contents">- “the SSC considers that the measures taken by the UK make any risk to human health from the UK DBES at least comparable to that in other European Member States”.</p>
<p class="contents">This followed a very thorough examination which focused on the concerns raised by the French authorities. I was greatly encouraged by the unanimous view of the Committee. It has provided the reassurance necessary that the DBES is sufficient to ensure that British beef exports are safe.</p>
<p class="contents">And let me be very clear: I have always insisted that the opinion of the committee would be instrumental in determining the Commission’s handling of this dispute. I have gone on record several times, including in my hearings before Parliament, that my decisions on food safety will be science-based. My priority is to ensure that there is no threat to public health. Sound, independent and excellent scientific advice is essential in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In this particular case, we now have scientific backing for the existing systems of controls.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on this basis that I have called on the French and German authorities to take the committee’s opinion into account and lift their national restrictions on imports of British beef. As I said on Friday, these restrictions are no longer necessary in the light of the safeguards in place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to accept that this is a highly charged issue where we need to proceed cautiously. This is why I also insisted on Friday that everybody needs a few days to reflect on the full implications of the scientific committee’s opinion. My meeting last night with my French and British counterparts was held in this spirit: we need to discuss the best way forward to resolve this dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">The French authorities have now requested clarification on five key points. Very briefly, they want further information on traceability, testing, derived products, controls and labelling. I do not consider this request for clarification to be unreasonable. Accordingly, a meeting of officials will take place this Friday to discuss the issues in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote the very short communiqué agreed by all participants last night which agreed this strategy:</p>
<p class="contents">“We have drawn up a method to emerge from the crisis as quickly as possible by identifying five points – <span class="italic">which I have already mentioned</span> – worthy of being looked at by our experts over the next few days. Our experts will begin this work on Friday. We undertake this work in a constructive spirit and a common will to assure public health of our citizens”.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very surprised at the reaction in the press to last night’s developments. It is not a setback. It is not a victory for France or a defeat for the UK. It is simply a further necessary stage in resolving this difficult issue. A few extra days in discussions is a very small price to pay for a successful conclusion. I need not add that the alternative – legal proceedings – would be a far longer and more painful process.</p>
<p class="contents">Some additional reassurances or clarifications may be necessary to allow the French authorities to lift their restrictions on UK beef. However, that should not prove to be an insurmountable problem and it is in that spirit that discussions should continue. It is the clear implication of these discussions that the ban will be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to make very clear that there is no question of re-writing the date-based export scheme. It has been upheld by the scientific steering committee as a set of reliable safeguards to ensure that British beef exported under the scheme is safe. It does not need to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will continue to insist on a very quick solution. Let me remind you that today is the very first working day since the adoption of the scientific committee’s opinion. We have all worked long and hard over the past several days and these efforts will continue until we have found a solution. I will, of course, continue to keep Parliament fully informed of developments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has had rather a baptism of fire as a new Commissioner. Would he agree with me that the situation as regards beef has now tended, in the public eye, to throw into chaos the question of the acceptability of judgments delivered at the European level on food safety and that this bodes rather ill for Mr Prodi’s plan for a European food safety agency? That is of great importance to my committee and will be of importance to this Parliament in the months to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically on the ban and the judgment of the Scientific Steering Committee, could he say why, if the judgment is so clear and unanimous, there is any need for further negotiation . . .</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">. . . or should we call it clarification. The boundary between clarification and negotiation seems – at least from the other side of the Channel – to be somewhat blurred. Will he take action against France after the Commission meeting on 10 November if, by that stage, having had several days to digest the unanimous decision, the French Government has taken no action to lift this ban?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather than throwing President Prodi’s plans for a food safety agency into chaos, it highlights the very need for such an agency at Community level. We are working on that very point in my service at the moment. Not only are we concerned to identify and establish its level of competence but also it would be of considerable importance to identify clearly and mark out the jurisdiction that the food safety agency would have at Community level and how it will interact with the agencies at Member State level. It will be important to identify where the function of one begins and ends and dovetails with the other. Once that has been clearly established, in my belief, the problem that we have seen over the last four or five weeks should not arise again.</p>
<p class="contents">I should emphasise also that, what we are engaged in now, and the exercise that is going to be undertaken on Friday and the subsequent days is, as I have said, a clarification. It is not a negotiation. A negotiation implies that two parties come to a negotiating table, each with their own views, and something comes out of it at the end which reflects both their views. What we are engaged in here is an exercise in clarification of the five points that I have referred to. The French authorities have not unreasonably requested more information in relation to these very important issues. Most of them are a request for information as to how the date-based export scheme actually operates, both on a practical level and on a technical level. My service is perfectly happy and willing to give that information to the French authorities. Civil servants from the UK will also be involved. There are practical considerations involved in how the issue works on the ground which are necessary to explain. So I am perfectly satisfied that it is more accurate to refer to this exercise as a clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event that my statement that the clear implication of this exercise is that there will be a lifting of the ban turns out to be incorrect, then, as I have said from the very beginning when we first saw this issue on Friday 1 October, there would be the initiation of infringement proceedings. That remains my view. I have said on numerous occasions since then that court proceedings would be the last option. I believe it is much better to achieve a result by discussion with the parties so as to ensure that everybody understands what is involved. That is the exercise we are engaged in at the moment. In the event that does not yield results, then my view that it is appropriate to bring infringement proceedings will prevail.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Do you also agree with me that you should make it compulsory, immediately – or rather in the next four weeks – for those Member States and all others to universally apply the newly evaluated BSE tests. No doubt the two Member States who still have an import ban will support you in this! Lastly, do you agree with me that even if there were – were, that is a subjunctive – if there were such an agency of the kind that Mr Prodi would like and which has not yet been fully discussed in this House, even if that were the case, a situation like this could recur again and again? The reason being, of course, that there would still be national agencies that could, at any time, claim that there was new scientific evidence. Would you therefore agree that your hope that a European agency could avoid such a situation is quite simply an illusion?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe, however, the clarifications that are asked for by the French authorities are not unreasonable. They are related to the date-based export scheme itself. They are related to five topics: traceability, further testing, issues surrounding derived products, further information relating to controls, inspection and controls by the Food and Veterinary Office on the single plant that exists in Truro, in Devon, which slaughters and exports this product, and finally, on the issue of labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the labelling issue, there is EU-wide legislation in draft at the moment, intended to be implemented by 1 January 2000. Those provisions have been put back for one year because Member States had not completed the preparatory work to enable the legislation to be implemented. In the meantime, the UK authorities have in place their own beef assurance scheme labelling system and have indicated that this labelling system, on a voluntary basis, would operate in respect of exports to France and elsewhere. That, I should stress, is being operated on a voluntary basis. It is not being legislated for at EU level. I would not have the competence nor the desire to do that. As a transitional measure, pending the final implementation of the EU-wide labelling system, this proposal has been put forward by the UK on a voluntary basis and will operate in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree fully with what you say, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, that there is no new scientific evidence being put forward by the French authorities. That was confirmed by the Scientific Steering Committee last week. There was up-to-date information but no new evidence to change the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the agency I can only refer you to the answer that I gave to Mrs Jackson that my belief is that the establishment of a centralised Commission level food safety authority will go a considerable distance to eliminating these kinds of difficulties. There may be teething problems along the way but it will be the challenge of all of us involved in establishing the legislation for that agency to ensure that the competences of each of the various institutions – whether they be at Community level or at Member State level – properly interact and that each side knows exactly where their competence begins and ends. In those circumstances one is in a position to bring more certainty, rather than less, into the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has dedicated himself to this in negotiations with me and then with Minister Glavany most assiduously. In my opinion the views and position that were adopted last night were the intelligent, rational, reasonable approach to adopt to this situation and, in my view, is far from a cave-in.

We already had occasion to say so on Friday and I think that the work being done by the Agriculture Ministers shows that it is crucial to find a compromise that is acceptable to everyone and not only to us, the MEPs who are rather trailing behind the news, but especially to consumers. If there is a problem today and French specialists have recommended that this ban should not be lifted, this means that there are some serious questions to be asked. Personally I am trying to put myself in the shoes of consumers who must by now have an idea of the situation. On the one hand you have a French food safety agency which says that there are in fact risks, and on the other, experts who tell us unanimously that there is no problem at all. Personally, this raises serious questions in my mind. I have read in the press that there are only three prion specialists on the Scientific Committee. I therefore turn to you, Commissioner, in order to find out if these three prion specialists really abstained, in which case those who voted unanimously were not prion specialists and we would then be able to understand why the proposals, the compromises and the supplementary questions tabled by France have been accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is part of the brief that I have been asked to undertake. I have noticed with interest and already welcomed the statement made by the French Minister for Trade and Consumer Protection, Mrs Lebranchu, who referred to the unanimous report of the Scientific Steering Committee over the weekend saying it would provide a reassurance to consumers. I welcome her statement in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a little confusion in relation to the interaction between the Ad Hoc Committee and the Scientific Steering Committee. I should like to shed some light on that at this stage, having been given the opportunity to do so by the last question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ad Hoc Committee is made up of experts on BSE. They met last Monday for the second time. On the previous occasion they were given the evidence from the French authority, which I had asked the French authorities to provide. They also asked for up-to-date information from the UK. They got that information also. They then met last Monday, considered all of that, applied their own experience to it and produced a report which, in effect, recited all of the issues involved and the aspects, dangers, risks and the pros and cons of the arguments relating to BSE. There was no vote taken by that committee. It is not their function to do so. It is an advisory ad hoc group that feeds into the legally established committee, established to carry out the function of advising the Commission in relation to these matters – that is, the Scientific Steering Committee. It is that committee that took the vote and it is that committee that was unanimous in its view, having reviewed all of the information that was contained in the Ad Hoc Group’s report and some other documents that were supplied by the Ad Hoc Group and obviously applying their own scientific knowledge. These sixteen scientists are drawn from most of the Member States. They are vets and scientists of the very highest calibre, at the pinnacle of their careers, people of the very highest reputation. They formed their view – which we now know – which was expressed unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is not any confusion or contradiction between any ad hoc view and the Scientific Steering Committee. That is the genesis of how the decision-making process actually takes place and the interaction between the Ad Hoc Committee and the Scientific Steering Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What good is the precautionary principle, Commissioner, when, if there is any doubt, we do not refrain from selling cattle that are still suspect?

In relation to the provenance of animals from labeling, you are correct to the extent that the legislative regime that is to be established at Community level will ultimately provide that products which are imported from another Member State will identify that it is of EU origin rather than from a Member State origin. What is happening in this situation is that on a voluntary basis the UK propose to keep on their beef the labelling that they have put in place under their beef assurance scheme. It is a purely voluntary aspect and it is not governed by legislation at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should say that I am absolutely satisfied as to the competence of the Scientific Steering Committee. It is made up of the chairmen of the eight scientific committees dealing with such issues as food, toxicology and other issues, and then eight others who were selected and appointed by the Commission. They are, let me emphasise, absolutely and completely independent. The Commission cannot tell them what to do, either in relation to the substance of their reports or indeed as to their timing.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to your reference to the Scottish scientists and so on, my understanding is that this issue relates solely to beef on the bone which is not part of the DBES scheme. I am not at all convinced that anything that the Scottish scientists have said on that issue is relevant to exportation from the UK under the DBES.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to your question on the precautionary principle, this is derived from a concept that was first laid down in the environment field. It lays down the basis on which the precautionary principle will be applied. It is quite specific in the way it says that it should be applied and one of the specific aspects is that there has to be an absence of scientific evidence in relation to a particular danger, or serious doubt as to the scientific evidence. We have a unanimous report from the best scientists and vets in the European Union available to the Commission and they have expressed their view that the British beef exported under the DBES scheme is as safe as any other beef in Europe. In those circumstances it is not appropriate to apply the precautionary principle.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with you that it is of paramount importance that this issue be resolved at European level for the reasons that I identified earlier. It is important for a number of reasons, not least consumer confidence, and it is to that end that I am trying to resolve this issue as I am sure also Minister Glavany and Minister Brown are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the date-based export scheme, of course I endorse it. I welcome the opportunity, in response to your question, to do so again. You may have noted I did so earlier and I have done so on a number of occasions. Let me repeat that it is not my intention to put forward any legislation to amend the date-based export scheme which itself is the subject of legislation. It is not my intention to do that and I have made that situation clear over the weekend on a number of occasions and I did so again yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">These improvements, as you describe them, are incremental. Some of them are not related to the application of the date-based export scheme but I have to say that some of them probably are, particularly in relation to the issue for instance of traceability, to the issues surrounding derived products. Some further information was requested as to how exactly the derived products scheme would operate under the DBES. Of course I am perfectly happy to give a clarification in relation to that but I should remind you of something that I am sure you are aware of: there is no exportation of processed beef under the DBES from the UK because it is necessary first to identify and approve a plant for that purpose and no such plant has been proposed by the UK authorities. Therefore there is no exportation of derived products under the DBES scheme but it may happen and in the event that it does, questions were asked of me yesterday to clarify exactly how it would work, how products might be segregated and so on. These are not unreasonable questions which I feel perfectly happy to answer over the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to when this should take place, the meeting is taking place on Friday, I would hope that it would conclude its deliberations and its explanations on Friday. There may be other meetings next week. I suspect that the French authorities may well have a further discussion with their food safety authority and I would expect a response from them certainly no later than Thursday of next week. I would then be in a position to first of all give an up-date to the Commission next Wednesday and give a final conclusive version on the following Tuesday at the Commission meeting in Strasbourg. It may all happen earlier. If it does, so much the better. If it does not, on Tuesday week I will be bringing a report to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did not think you could go any higher than that. Now we are told by Mr Byrne that we need just a few extra days of discussions. Well, it appears to me that we have had three months since 1 August in which the French and the Germans have defied EU law. Are you now telling me Mr Byrne that during those three months when a vast dossier was prepared by the French food safety agency that they did not examine the technical implications embracing traceability, testing, derived products, controls and labelling? Are you telling me that only now at this last minute after the scientific steering committee has made its unanimous pronouncement they want further technical clarification of those points? It seems ludicrous. What exactly are they asking for?</p>
<p class="contents">We heard Mr Martinez questioning the competence of the Scientific Steering Committee. Is Mr Martinez aware, and are you Commissioner aware, of the fact that the AFSSA, the French food safety agency, has an annual budget of EUR 52 million and has a board of governors of whom 50% are appointed by the French government, the other 50% representing farmers, food retailers and food distributors? So let us ask some questions about their competence. We were assured at the highest level in Paris that this matter was not being driven by protectionism but was being driven purely by science. This smacks to me of pure commercial protectionism and now it has been exposed. Are you aware this is the way that the AFSSA is being driven, Mr Byrne?</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that as long as we do not have consistent labelling, we will never be free of disputes about BSE in this House and in Europe in general. The fact that you are now telling us that compulsory labelling going back to animals’ place of birth will not be implemented until 2003 – Mr Böge has already touched on this – well, in my opinion that is partly to blame for this whole cankerous BSE crisis. Now that the legal basis has changed – and that is the reason why we have this new regulation now – so that this is no longer to be dealt with under Article 37, that is by means of consultation, but under Article 152, under the co-decision procedure – we in this House damned well have a duty to bring this deadline forward from 2003! Yes, that is our duty, and my question to you is this: you said that you would put pressure on these countries concerning this issue, which is to be the subject of a decision in the next few days. I would like to know what scope the Commission has for exerting pressure so that these Member States bring in consistent labelling and identification of bovine animals before 2003? If that could be done as quickly as possible, we in this House would not have to worry about BSE any more! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as this agency is concerned, it could take one of two forms. The one that I find quite positive would consist of creating an authority formed by a group of European experts without detracting from the decision-making power of national states on the fundamental issues which are the closest to citizens’ concerns. There is quite another concept which I feel is much more negative and this consists of establishing an additional feature which would take away a nation’s right to safeguard themselves, a right which is nevertheless inalienable. This form would, because the Commission seems unable to act in any other way, immediately prioritise the free movement of goods over consumers’ health, as we have just seen in the business of the ban on British beef and veal where, Madam President, we should really wait until the tests are available. Furthermore, this leads us to the following extraordinary conclusion that the precautionary principle is not being applied within the European Union, when we are trying to make it prevail in relations with third countries, particularly with the United States. </p>
<p class="contents">Well, Commissioner, what form would you choose for the food agency; one which takes a flexible and liberal approach towards countries, or one which takes an authoritarian approach towards countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have had a number of discussions with colleagues and with Members of Parliament also in relation to this on an informal basis. So work is proceeding on this issue. No final decisions of course have been taken and, as I said to you a moment ago, the constitutional structure of that authority has yet to be decided and how it would interact with the other institutions of the European Union and with the national food safety agencies of Member States. It also has to be carefully choreographed because we want to rule out any difficulties like the ones we are faced with at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to be careful about, as you say, the removal of Member States’ inalienable rights because any interference with the Member States’ rights may very well encroach upon the rights of Member States’, thereby requiring Treaty changes. I am not sure that we want at this stage to move quite that far. I am not ruling that out, but I want you to understand that in addressing your question in that way you should be aware that for progress to be made in that particular area, if it is intended to reduce the jurisdiction or the rights of Member States, Treaty changes would be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just finally address the issue of the precautionary principle you mentioned. I have mentioned the precautionary principle in the context of imports from the United States and I am sure you are referring to beef and hormone-treated beef. I have referred to that in this House and I have referred to that in the Environment Committee on a number of occasions. I have to point out to you that the advice that I am receiving from the scientists in the European Commission is that the beef imported from the United States contains the hormone 17-beta-oestradiol. I am advised that is a complete carcinogen. In those circumstances, it is appropriate to apply the scientific evidence rather than the precautionary principle because with clear scientific evidence, it is open to me and the Commission to make a decision based on that scientific evidence. It is only in the absence of scientific evidence, or where there is a clear uncertainty in relation to scientific evidence, that the precautionary principle comes into play. So that is why we do not apply the precautionary principle to the hormone issue on the importation of beef from the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I just wonder whether or not, having listened to all the debates, you are actually totally and utterly aware of the devastating effect of this decision on UK farmers. You have said already quite clearly that the standing committee on scientific evidence is the highest authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jackson asked you as the very first question if we have another committee to look at our food safety across the European Union will that actually be better than the present standing committee and will people take any notice of it. It appears to me that they have not taken any notice of it. You actually argued almost to the contrary that in actual fact the standing committee on scientific evidence is probably not as good as a food agency. British farmers are suffering as a result of indecision. It is about time the decision was ratified. The previous speaker said in a few days; it was actually in August the decision was taken. How many more days do we need to have a decision?</p>
<p class="contents">Can I also ask you: there is a practice within Member States, or some Member States, to feed what I would call banned substances to some of their beef cattle. Is the scientific committee and the Commission going to look at that? Or are we going to continue with a situation where the press are just going to use it to attack Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, all I say to you is that British farmers, the European Union and agriculture are suffering as a result of indecision. We want to see the decision taken on Friday evening, not waiting until Strasbourg. There is no more scientific evidence. Did the French sign up to the Florence agreement? Has the United Kingdom met all the conditions that were laid down in that agreement? Why has a decision not been taken immediately?</p>

<p class="contents">I have said on a number of occasions – and I have said it again here today – that I believe that the application of steady diplomacy, cool heads with firm determination, will make more progress than knee-jerk reactions resulting in the Commission ending up in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg two years hence. It will not do the farmers of the UK any good, in my view, if the ban remains in place in the intervening two-year period.</p>

For much of the debate, I have had the impression that a kind of war was being fought to see whether it would be Great Britain or France who would lose face. I think that that is not what the issue – or the debate – is about, but it does affect the following question in a major way: what is being proposed for European consumers as a whole? British consumers, just like French and Spanish consumers, have the right to know what they are eating and from this point of view, I consider labelling and traceability to be both unavoidable and essential. </p>
<p class="contents">But, Commissioner, should it not be pointed out that the source of the whole business, geographically speaking, is Great Britain.

Because there is a farming system there that is particularly geared towards high productivity, because there more than anywhere else, farmers are sacrificed at the altar of the food-processing industry and because instead of crying over British farmers, we would do better to help them to achieve sound means of production, more appropriate means of production. This is something they have already begun to do. I would not want to forget to mention the fact that at the worst moments of this mad cow crisis, the Welsh and the Scots, who have continued to maintain more traditional farming methods, have been punished in the same way as English producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, please tell me what financial resources will be released to pay for traceability, for the slaughter of whole herds in which there is a single case of BSE, for cases of cattle plague, because that is the only way we will be able to reassure consumers. I also think that from this point of view, every European country needs to stop repeating the words “precautionary principle”, as we have done for years, whilst continuing to practise the same frenzied methods of high productivity, and to highlight two or three rather limited examples in order to exercise their rights. Well, Commissioner, what resources will this agency be given? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The characterisation of this difficult matter in those terms is quite unhelpful. Also, those who address it in that way do not give full justice to the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with you that assurance for consumers is of paramount importance. It is the DBES scheme which has been devised by the Commission with the advice of the scientists which, in my opinion and the opinion of those scientists who advise the Commission in these matters, will give that assurance to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with you that it is extremely valuable to have labelling and traceability. In relation to the labelling issue, you have asked me what will be put in place at Community level in the legislation regarding labelling. From 2003, all beef will be labelled with place of birth, place of fattening, place of slaughter, breed and age of the animal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to provide this labelling and information at present because the Member States have not yet provided the information for that to happen. But it is being addressed and that will be the situation from that date.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, I should like to emphasise the importance that I attach to this entire issue in terms of consumer confidence and, in particular, the issue of public health. It is my intention to take this into account over the next number of days in the on-going discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
