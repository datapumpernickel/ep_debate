<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the European industrial, scientific and technological base is essential to the security of the European Union. It is that base which provides the capacity and capability which makes possible the political and military pillars of the European defence identity as expressed through the CFSP, the WEU and NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">That statement is as true today as when I made it in my first report nearly two years ago. Yet that base continues to get weaker despite the fact that Europe has some outstanding companies. We have lost 50 % of the jobs in this sector in the last 10 years. In 1995 the EU imported from the US six times the value of its exports. In 1985 the ratio was 4: 1. The reasons for this are set out very clearly in my first report but can be summed up in one statistic: we have 43 defence‐related companies and a defence budget of 94.5 billion euros; The US has 14 defence companies and a defence budget of 212 billion euros. A further 75 % of what we import comes from the USA. We do not even trade with each other, intra‐EU trade being only 4 % or 5 % of procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not that we are not aware of the problem. I have spent the last 3 years attending endless conferences where everyone is agreed on the problem, most people agree on the solution, but very few people seem willing to take the necessary action. This is one field where rhetoric and action almost never meet. I often feel, in fact, that all the players involved are cautiously circling each other in an elaborately choreographed 18th century dance when in fact what we need at this moment is a good dose of rock‐and‐roll. I am sure that Commissioner Bangemann will be quite happy to lead that rock‐and‐roll.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there has been progress. There has been the establishment of POLARM. We have had the defence armament section in the Amsterdam Treaty. We have had the setting up of OCCAR. We have had declarations by Heads of State saying how important this is. We had the letter of intent of 6 July by the six defence ministers which was actually a vital step along the way, as indeed was the code of conduct on arms sales. We have had the WEAG action plan decided last November but action is not always carried through in this section. Last year there was the announcement of the intention to set up a European aerospace and defence company but nobody can agree how we do it and there is a battle between those who believe there should be heavy state investment and those who believe it should be a private company.</p>
<p class="contents">We agreed a long time ago that there should be a single corporate entity for Airbus but this has still not actually been signed. It has become rather like watching the Becket play <span class="italic">Waiting for Godot</span> . Westland and Agusta helicopters were meant to be merging but they are still wrangling about simple matters of valuation. British Aerospace and DASA were meant to be merging but could not agree on the basis of the shareholding which is incompatible. We have had the often proposed but never consummated marriage between Aérospatiale and Dassault.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in Europe, it takes us three times as long to create a merger as it does in the USA and the end result is smaller. British Aerospace/Matra has sales of 1.5 billion dollars compared to its main US competitor with sales of 5 billion dollars. I will say nothing more about the saga of Euro‐fighter, the <span class="italic">Horizon</span> or the multi‐role armoured vehicle. Compare that little minuet with the rock‐and‐roll in the United States where, since 1992, there has been a mass of mergers resulting in basically 3 1/2 major companies.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is essential that we take action now. We must use all our resources. There should be no institutional wrangling. There should be no standing on our dignity or on ceremony. The Commission's recent communication is so important because it shows a willingness to use all the means that we have at our disposal whether they are Community or Member State instruments. Firstly, companies have to be allowed to get on with it following commercial logic. Governments should stand back and only use Article 223 where it is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">That is indeed what British Aerospace is doing, which is probably the closest we have got in the industry to a leather‐jacketed rocker, in their amalgamation and mergers with companies like Saab and Matra. The recent merger with GEC/Marconi is a good deal because it is based on the principles of shareholder value and a sound financial footing is important if we are to get value for money for the taxpayer. It is also important because what we have seen in the US is that mergers have gone along like Noah's ark, two by two. They have not tried to force too many companies together at one time. That is why I think the British Aerospace merger with Marconi makes good sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we now need to follow the Commission action plan and apply the principles of a single market as far as possible. We should also use the instruments of CFSP in defining a common position on armaments cooperation, although that common position has to be flexible, bearing in mind the needs of this particular industry. We also need to establish greater clarity in the CFSP and the function of the European defence identity which is why the initiative of the British Prime Minister and the San Malo Agreement are so important. We need to define exactly what the Petersberg Tasks involve for our military so that industry knows what equipment it needs to be providing. On procurement, we must move towards a European armament agency, bringing together OCCAR and WEAG in a loose arrangement, if necessary. There has to be greater coordination here as indeed there has to be on research. We have to establish that the best deliverer gets the contract. We should now no longer rely on a <span class="italic">juste retour</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, if we do not start rocking the Americans are going to roll all over us. Having said that, it is not intended that this report should be anti‐American. Rather we need a strong industry if we are to compete with or collaborate with the Americans and if we are to fulfil the security demands of NATO under the European defence identity. We should be looking to collaborate with the Americans. This, after all, is a global industry. European companies are not really European companies any more. They have investments in the United States and companies like Boeing have investments in Europe. So let us stop this artificial distinction and build a strong European industry to collaborate with the Americans. In fact, I know the industry will hate me for saying this, but the logical consequence of the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas merger is that the next step forward should be a link between Airbus and Lockheed Martin. Then we will have global competition in the aerospace industry.</p>

If the will to defend them had not existed in Europe and America when it was most needed, we would not be sitting here today. In Europe, experience has taught us that a feeling of security prevents war and helps bring about the disintegration of powerful dictatorships from within. Where an adequate system of defence provides security, ideas about freedom can penetrate and break down even the thickest of walls.</p>
<p class="contents">The men and women charged with the task of dealing with European defence are entitled to have access to new weapons. The question we should now be asking ourselves is whether some of those weapons could be developed and manufactured in Europe. The response of this committee, including myself, is an unconditional ‘yes'. It is essential for Europe to keep ahead, and even to be right at the forefront in certain areas. If we have something to offer as producers, we shall also be respected as customers. Otherwise, we are more likely to have to make do with what we are offered, and at the seller's price.</p>
<p class="contents">During a long period of peace – something we dare hope may continue – it is natural that we should reduce our defence expenditure. It is therefore all the more important for us to coordinate our dwindling European defence industry, so that by maintaining its competitiveness it will be capable of furnishing us with the arms we need to defend ourselves adequately. There will also be more likelihood of the United States wishing to exchange its experience and defence materials with us.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following Mr Titley"s very impassioned plea there should really be no need to discuss this report further. Let me begin by thanking Gary Titley for his report in which he tirelessly addressed and discussed a subject that is most important in both economic and defence and security policy terms. Economically, we should have no illusions. The United States of America, which of course always stands up for totally free trade, for totally free economic development, shows enormous interest and activity when it is a question of defending its own industry and securing its position on the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is particularly true of anything to do with the defence industry, the aircraft industry and so forth. So unless it is to be naive, Europe must respond to this kind of competition, but without creating new monopoly positions. But what we have here is in fact global competition, to which we must of course respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in regard to defence policy, we are currently talking – and for the time being we are merely talking but I hope we will soon be taking concrete steps – about a European defence identity. We are talking about Europe having to assume certain tasks without always stealing a glance at NATO or in particular the United States to check what they are going to do. This kind of European defence identity cannot imply full self‐sufficiency, yet a minimum of independence for our arms industry, coupled, of course, with cooperation with the Americans, is absolutely necessary. I hope Gary Titley is right in saying that what is currently happening between British and American undertakings does not prevent the corresponding decisions and mergers from taking place at European level. On the contrary, perhaps this will even create a pressure for rapidly taking the necessary decisions now to build up a European industry, not against the Americans but as strong partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let me point out something that is also contained in the report although it is not its main subject. We in the European Parliament should also talk about disarmament when we talk about defence. The Social Democrats do not believe that all these endeavours to create a European security identity, a European defence industry, conflict with further steps towards disarmament. That is still on the agenda! The safest world is a world in which disarmament is writ large, which is why we should not play one aspect off against the other. Sadly this is a world in which arms are necessary, in which we have to continue to modernise. We should do so at European level while at the same time fighting for global, world disarmament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">De Melo </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are used to Mr Titley"s numerous well‐prepared reports and speeches on the subject of defence‐related industries. Mr Titley"s work as a whole represents a commendable effort by this House to bring the matter to the attention of the European institutions and to call for changes to an inadequate policy on the military equipment of the Member States" armed forces. I and my group are in total agreement with Mr Titley"s report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am rather pessimistic about just how dynamic a European arms policy would be within a common defence policy, as mentioned in paragraph 3 of the report. In actual fact I believe that only an effective common defence policy will allow a concerted strategy to be convincingly and properly achieved in the European arms industry. But in my opinion, it will take many years for common actions to be realised in defence policy. We are reassured by the protection provided by the Americans in terms of defence, although we regret our subordinate position in foreign affairs. While this situation continues, I do not envisage there being a strong will, particularly among certain Member States, to develop and genuinely accept an EU strategy on military equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may briefly refer to bilateral and multilateral cooperation, for which I do not want to take the credit, these initiatives which often benefit from WEU support must also be praised. However, they can be sporadic and timid, lacking the comprehensive political will of the EU. With every year that passes, we in the European Union are falling further behind our American allies in terms of the quality of our military equipment. This is also true in defence matters. This is why we are increasingly followers and no longer leaders in world policy. Mr Titley"s report, by drawing the EU"s attention to these problems, deserves credit and also, therefore, our full support.</p>

The European industry is fragmented and is losing the competition war to our American rivals. Fortunately, the industry itself takes occasional steps in the direction of cooperation, mergers or expansions. But the legislation has to keep pace with it all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States made a big mistake in keeping the defence industry out of the single market, at Amsterdam as well. In seeking to defend their own national industry, our Heads of Government have signed that industry"s death warrant. I hope today"s Commission proposals may change this. But Europeanising the industry also means Europeanising the export control regulations. Last July"s code of conduct was a first small step, and now we need further steps.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, the Liberal Group, backs the German Presidency"s proposals to have this code of conduct made mandatory as part of the legislation. The issues here are not just the industry, but the legislation too. I should also like to thank Mr Titley for giving us so much of his time as we discussed his report, both in the Subcommittee on Security and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. My compliments to him.</p>

However, specifically in relation to armament issues, I think it would be better if his passion and, I would say, fanaticism were to give way to a greater sense of reality and cool‐headedness. For I believe it would be a mistake for the European Union to become involved, so to speak, in a frenzy of competition with the United States over arms industry issues when the European Union still has no principles and basic mechanisms for its foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">When we see that over major issues, as for example the recent attack on Iraq, some countries align themselves with the Americans, other countries pretend an ostrich‐like blindness, and others still make critical comments, how and upon what are we to base such an armaments policy? I think we are moving into dangerous territory. The important thing would be to establish the principles and fundamentals of our foreign policy and only then to look at economic and similar aspects related to military equipment for defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I too wish to stress that Mr Titley's report contains important observations which we will support despite our primary overall position, such as the issue of continuing the Konver programme, such as the subject of measures against anti‐personnel mines, and such as the subject of a weapons export code which, we fear, will remain no more than a general principle. And we know very well that the European Union countries persist in the iniquity of exporting the weapons they manufacture to various regimes around Europe, even the most odious and bloodthirsty among them.</p>

We are living in a post‐cold war era. Europe is surrounded only by friends. This is an age of peace. It is the age of disarmament. It is the arms industry that is not prepared to adapt to the new criteria of an age of disarmament and that is sounding the alarm. It is calling for industrial mergers that would not be approved in the civil sector. It is calling for subsidies, for political support for arms exports; it is calling for a more flexible policy on cartels. What forces us to give in to these demands when we know that it would be senseless to do so, when we know that this will not solve the global problems facing mankind, the problems of unemployment and poverty, the problems of climate change? Do not forget that we created Konver to replace rather than supplement rearmament. That is why the Greens reject this report.</p>

There are too many arms in the world, nuclear weapons must be banned outright and conventional weapons must be drastically reduced. There is too much selling of arms to unstable areas, whether legal or not, and it merely adds to the level of violence and insecurity in the world. The codes of conduct are inadequate and poorly enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are asking for a European policy, then we say yes to a European foreign policy and a European security policy which pursues the above priority objectives. We want arms where they are absolutely essential. The only thing to which I can give my unreserved support, and this is my personal view, is that the matter should be coordinated within a common European area. For the rest, I have other priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to see a common policy of arms reduction. I should like to see our own defence industry converted into an industry which pursues peaceful objectives. I should like to see as few people as possible dependent on the defence industry for their livelihoods. I want legally binding export controls for arms at European level. I shall certainly endorse the call for the Council to submit an annual consolidated report on arms exports to Parliament so that we can check on how the codes of conduct are being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, there seems to be very little of the European spirit behind the restructuring operations currently under way.</p>

Good idea, it is never too late to do something good like this! The Titley report wants Europe"s security and defence identity to be asserted – I am with him up to this point – but he goes on to say that this should be within NATO, which I find very disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">As sceptical as I am, in its time, the Soviet monster was reason enough, in my eyes, to justify the fact that Europe should forget all conflicts of interest that pitted it against the United States in order to present a united front against a common threat. Since then, as the European Union has developed, such points of conflict have only become more apparent. Today, nothing short of an attack by extra‐terrestrial monsters could make me forget that Europe is the United States" main competitor and that the United States will not rest until they have thwarted our expansion.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, a free Europe cannot thrive without saying ‘no" to NATO.</p>

It is very much in line with convictions which many of us hold and which we reaffirm, because controlling arms production and exports, indeed raising this issue, is already a way of preventing policy being made by weapons and those who use them, which is exactly what we do not want. So it is an important report, and for three reasons in particular. First, because it evaluates Europe"s defence industry in terms of forming European groups and competing with others, especially the United States industry, supporting scientific research and cutting‐edge technology and, finally, in parallel, establishing coordination between the Member States to offer a frame of reference.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because talking about the defence industry is a direct reminder of the need to get the common foreign and security policy off the ground, which is essential to the European Union"s international credibility – and here I believe coordination with the applicant countries in the enlargement process is important too.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, because I think it is right to highlight the fact that we are establishing a code of conduct for arms exports. This code governs a very sensitive area, introduces morality to it, makes it transparent and specifically prevents arms exports being in contradiction with European Union policy. It is significant that the German Presidency recently stated its intention of making the code of conduct more legally binding. That is the right road.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think it is right to mention that the Titley report contains a small paragraph, which we should bear in mind, on the ratification of the Ottawa Treaty on Anti‐Personnel Mines by all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So all things considered, I think this is an important report.</p>

Unfortunately perhaps, that requires an arms and arms procurement policy coordinated at European level. Why? Firstly, I am convinced that it is important for Europe to retain some independence in providing itself with military assets. What I regard as important is not so much economic competition but a policy that is independent of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is also quite crucial for us to reduce our existing surplus capacity in the arms industry only on a basis of coordination, thereby also preventing financial resources from being wrongly allocated to arms contracts that are awarded under the heading of ‘we want to protect jobs by creating more employment". We are all familiar with examples of this kind in our own home countries. I also believe it is important that we consistently include the Central and Eastern European countries. They are facing the biggest problems here and I believe, especially in view of EU and also NATO enlargement, that it is important that we include them here. I regret – here I agree with the direction taken in the report – that the Konver programme is not being continued. We have to demand that it is!</p>
<p class="contents">In the end it is not a question of markets. The arms industry is not a question of markets and I believe that security policy is the decisive aspect, which is why it is important that we coordinate the arms industry, arms procurement, on a European basis in the interests of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elmalan </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from its 1996 communication, in 1997 the Commission put forward an action plan for defence‐related industries. It refuses to make allowance for the specific nature of this sector, particularly in terms of the close link between defence and sovereignty, and is determined to apply the principle of free competition for the sake of competitiveness. It is even going one step further by opening the way for a European armaments policy within the framework of a European security and defence identity.</p>
<p class="contents">These guiding principles, approved by the report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, are reflected in the restructuring policies that have been implemented in the Member States. Such restructuring, in the form of merger‐acquisition operations at a global level, is based more on financial grounds than purely industrial ones and has serious economic, social and regional consequences. For example, the French Government is pressing ahead with the restructuring and privatisation of the armaments industries, jeopardising more than 50 000 jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Being active supporters of peace and disarmament, the French Members of my group support cutting expenditure on armaments, particularly on nuclear weapons. We also suggest that an international conference on reducing the arms trade be organised, which could lead to an international convention. But at the same time, we are against the restructuring and privatisation that cost so many jobs. Currently, only 5 % of France"s requirements are met by state enterprises and munitions plants. This is why we believe that the arms we need to defend ourselves should be provided by national enterprises, despite the fact that the Commission thinks that the rules governing public procurement should be applied to military equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">The industrial activity generated could also go hand in hand with strengthened cooperation at European level, but without giving up all our advantages, technology and know‐how to achieve this. Such cooperation will only be effective if it is complemented by the establishment of a genuine Community preference for arms purchases, so we can stand up to a dominant America that has cornered 50 % of the world market. This approach is further justified by the fact that 75 % of major conventional weapons bought by European countries come from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to begin, and continue with, the process of diversifying and reorientating some military activities to the civilian sphere, particularly the aeronautical, space and electronic industries. As the CGT, France"s national state workers" union, stressed, the engineering and technical staff of these armaments plants have industrial skills and know‐how and use technologies that could quite easily be used for civilian purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Such diversification will only be truly effective if social measures are also introduced, such as reduced working time and improved training, in order to safeguard employment and keep sites operational in places where economic and social life is almost exclusively dependent on the armaments industry.</p>

This presupposes a scaling‐down of both the manufacture and sale of arms. The EU should take the lead on disarmament and limiting the arms trade. This should be a constant element in any discussion on the European defence industry. Although the international arms trade is a global problem, the Member States of the Union together represent the second most important player in the international arms market and therefore have a particular responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Titley has certainly done an excellent job, but I cannot agree with him when he says, in paragraph 3, that ‘a European arms policy is an essential element in... the establishment of a European security and defence identity within NATO'. Sweden is a neutral and non‐aligned country; it does not belong to NATO and will not be involved in a common defence. Moreover, I do not believe that it is appropriate to create an institution to deal with arms production before any decision has been taken on a common defence.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Article 223 of the EC Treaty, in my view armaments cannot be regarded in the same light as other goods and traded freely; on the contrary, they should be subject to special rules. The EU should play an active role, not in making it easier for the arms industry to produce and export weapons, but in tightening up the rules so as to limit the sale and export of armaments.</p>

However, such a perspective is entirely missing from Mr Titley's report. Instead, it is all about building a common defence and devising a common code of conduct for the arms industry and exports. A report of this kind should be seeking to formulate a strategy for turning a military capability into a civil one. If the EU adopts a more active and aggressive approach to the export of arms, this will also serve to aggravate conflict situations where they occur in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I also disagree with paragraph 2, where it is stated that European research and technology policy should begin to be used for military purposes. On the contrary, we should be redirecting the enormous resources squandered on military research into the civil sector, where they will at least be of some benefit to the human race.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the report does not adequately take account of the fact that some EU Member States do not belong to NATO or the WEU. Nevertheless, the rapporteur would like these structures to be included in the Western European Union and in cooperation links with NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also unhappy that, as we can see, extending NATO to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is having the effect of encouraging them to energetically rebuild their defence capabilities, which only leads to more countries in turn equipping themselves with new weapons systems. As a result, tension is likely to increase in Europe rather than the reverse – even if some arms manufacturers are made happy in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that there should be an international code of conduct to limit arms exports, but this proposal goes much further than that. I am therefore going to vote against what is, for the most part, a very reactionary report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, first let me thank Mr Titley, and not just for the fact that in terms of substance his report follows the lines proposed by the Commission but also for his realism and for the courage that is indeed required in order to deal realistically such a difficult subject. That is why I want to begin with a very simple statement, before Mr Sjöstedt leaves. This is what we so often see in debates: a Member tells us something or other and then leaves. He never listens to what the others have to say.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with a very simple statement. I do not believe there is much dispute in the European Parliament about the need for a Common Security and Defence Policy. A Common Security and Defence Policy, as its name suggests, is not some kind of policy of aggression but reflects the need in a world in which, unfortunately, we cannot guarantee security by peaceful methods alone, to build up a system that shows the public that we are able to defend ourselves. That is why, even in a neutral country such as Sweden, there is no question at all about having a national defence system of its own.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sjöstedt, if in relative terms the European Union were to export as many weapons as Sweden, we would have to increase our exports considerably. The reason why NATO adopts a different approach to Sweden than to Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania is partly because Sweden was never part of the Soviet Union. So we should begin by stating quite soberly that we do need to defend ourselves. That is my first point. The second is that if that need exists and if it will take some time before we can achieve a common security policy – which is not easy politically – then, if it is going to take us another five or ten years to achieve that common security policy and if when we have finally achieved it we no longer have a common arms policy, we will face the problem that although we have a common security policy we have no means of producing weapons ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who does not understand that is beyond help! That is why the Commission has taken the initiative of telling Parliament and the Member States that we have to do something. For one thing is clear: our industrial policy approach in this area has been purely national to date. That will not get us any further. The complaints that have been made here, by Mrs Elmalan too, I believe, that we are constantly losing ground to American exports to the European Union, are true! The reason is simply that the European industry is too widely dispersed among national undertakings, so that it does not achieve the same overall market penetration as some American undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">We should just look at the order of magnitude. If all the companies that produce arms in Europe joined forces, merged, they would still not be as big as the largest American undertaking operating in this area. That is also a question of industrial policy. The answer lies not just with the Commission, with the European Parliament and the European Union, it also lies with the Member States. All the Member States have said they are aware of the need to restructure the industry. The same applies to the Airbus. Just recently the six countries cooperating on the Airbus came together again. The problem there is quite simple. Each country begins by defending its own interests, and sometimes its own policy. The reason France finds it more difficult to privatise <span class="italic">Aérospatiale</span> is not because <span class="italic">Aérospatiale</span> does not want this but because the current French Government has more problems with this than a different government would have had. The reason two UK firms have now merged is partly because if this aviation merger takes place, a company that has more influence can of course make more demands. So we must realise that a kind of power struggle is taking place here. It would be naive to disregard that.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time all these trends show that the industry and the Member States have realised that something has to be done here. I consider Mr Titley"s report on this very difficult question most encouraging – it is easy enough for some people, including Mr Frischenschlager, to take the position that the right method is in fact to disarm. The European Union would certainly be the first to accept that if we could make sure it applied worldwide. Sadly, that is not an option. That is why we have to take a different road.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed an action plan that quite clearly states what we can do. I can assure you that the Commission will propose and implement all the necessary aspects of this action plan this year. Standardisation is the first aspect. On public contracts: what Mrs Elmalan said on the subject is the usual reflex in some EU Member States; when a problem arises, people take refuge in protectionism and in a European quota. You could call it agricultural policy transposed to the arms industry. But that is the very last thing we should do. That would not get us any further at all.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must muster the strength to create competitive structures. That means: common standards, joint invitations to tender, for the European arms industry can only become competitive if it issues joint invitations to tender and has common rules on the internal arms trade and on arms exports. The European Court of Justice has on several occasions ruled that arms exports also lie within the Community"s sphere of competence. The Commission will do all it can to make progress in this area, for if we do not act now, we cannot complain five years hence that we cannot even ensure our own defence any more. I believe we should follow a good European tradition here. We should be able to produce for ourselves what we need for our own defence. That is precisely the Commission"s aim and I am glad Mr Titley also sees it that way and supports it.</p>
