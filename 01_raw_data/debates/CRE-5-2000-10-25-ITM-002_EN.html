It gives me great pleasure to do so. I should also like to refer to the 19 amendments we have before us on this report. I accept 16 of them. The three that I do not accept are Amendments Nos 14, 16 and 17, and I prefer 15 to 5 and 10 to 6.</p>
<p class="contents">As Feuerbach said: "der Mensch ist, was er isst", man is what he eats. We are what we eat – and sadly that is true in my case. I am clearly what I eat.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">More seriously, as a result of eating badly some people suffer long-term illness and indeed some people die of food poisoning their bodies. Over recent decades we have seen many scandals: olive oil, contaminated wine, mineral water, beef, dioxins and sludge. We have learned the new vocabulary of e-coli, salmonella and listeria and so on. We have had scare and scandal leading to fear, panic and public enquiry. Our constituents around Europe look to us to reassure them that the food they eat is safe and the water they drink is drinkable. They have lost faith in the current machinery and mechanisms to control and remove risk from "farm to table", in the phrase that is so often used.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that you cannot eliminate risk. That is not within our grasp. Risk will always occur from animal feed and crop sprays of agriculture to the processing of food, transport, refrigeration, storage and retailing. And then the risk goes on to our own home, our kitchens, our larders and to our cooking skills and habits in those kitchens.</p>
<p class="contents">If we cannot eliminate risk, we can at least take action to identify it and manage it. New action is needed. We must put into place a framework of legislation, guidance and good practice on food, feed, pesticides, dioxins, labelling, additives, novel foods and so on. Alongside that framework we need a new body to restore public confidence and the respect of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My report proposes the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency which should be authoritative, independent, objective, accountable, transparent and intelligible. Its focus must be on safety and its method must be science. Its task is risk assessment and then giving advice on that risk management. The Commission's task is risk management and control. Parliament's task will be the scrutiny and monitoring of both.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a rapid alert system. That needs to be improved but it can only be swiftly accountable to Parliament if it continues to be run by the Commission. Nevertheless it should be physically and operationally close to the EFSA. Its remit should be extended to cover feedstuffs as well as foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The director of the ESFA is key. His appointment must be by the Commission, but after a hearing by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, probably involving other committees such as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. There needs to be an annual report and presentation to Parliament and risk reports coming to the Commission, Parliament and the Council. The board needs to reflect the range of relevant experience in production, processing, retailing, consumption, law and so on. Scientists need to give a report on assessment to the board who then makes sure that it is in terms the consumers understand, add any recommendations on risk management and submit it to the Commission and to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We need close working with national food safety authorities and with international bodies. We need to see the work of the current five scientific committees and the Steering Committee subsumed within this. It will be within a small headquarters, professionally run, accessible to the Commission and Parliament, although the site is not for now.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank my colleagues of all parties and all Member States. I thank them for the constructive dialogue we have had. I thank the Commission and its staff. I thank the Council and the French Presidency for their messages of support. I thank Parliament's secretariat. We have here a proposal which can work to improve the safety of our foods, to restore the confidence of the public in our respective nations. I hope that Parliament will endorse it.</p>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Bowis, has drawn up a superb report, which highlights the importance of an excellent, independent food authority, which would have responsibility for risk assessment, but not for risk management or crisis management, which must be the competence of the Commission, as must legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Both this food authority and the legislative proposals being proposed, which aim to guarantee food safety, will receive the support of this House, Commissioner. But I would like to draw attention to a fundamental issue: the best possible legislation and an excellent, scientifically unimpeachable food authority are not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We may have other food crises and, each time this happens, consumer safety will be endangered, as will the credibility of the institutions and the interests of the agricultural sector and the agri-foodstuffs industry. And, what is more, if crisis management is inadequate, the problem uncontrollably spreads and worsens.</p>
<p class="contents">Food safety is not an ancillary issue: it affects public health and the stability of the food market. I therefore ask the Commission what it plans to do in order to make the objectives of the White Paper reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent experience has shown that the series of crises is not due to a lack of scientific knowledge nor to a lack of <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>legislation. The problem has been that somebody has been dishonest and has continued to be so due to inadequate controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Such was the case with the company that manufactured polio vaccines in the United Kingdom using bovine foetal serum, prohibited since 1999, and with the distribution via a French agri-foodstuffs distribution chain of one thousand kilos of meat from herds contaminated with BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, Commissioner, along with the authority, the relevant Commission services must, in collaboration and coordination with the Member States, establish a system of efficient, standardised controls throughout the food chain, and the network of food laboratories in the European Union must be improved and their work coordinated with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure you that this is the best method, as it is preventative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Food must be safe and must be pure. We must be certain that the carcasses of BSE cows do not end up in the food chain. We must be able to rely on the fact that salmonella is being tackled. But that confidence is being shattered time after time. The more than eighty measures from the White Paper are therefore indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting up the European Food Safety Agency is a major step in the right direction. Its key task is providing scientific advice, for the discussion on food safety must be pure too. Emotions run high where food is concerned: against globalisation, large-scale production and genetic modification, and in favour of local produce, tradition and diversity. Those emotions are often justified, but we must ensure that they do not become a cover for protectionism. Whilst acknowledging the boom in ready-made food, we must also adopt a pro-active approach. The new food must be of quality, the ingredients traceable, and labels must offer honest information. Consumers deserve a choice. The food authority must provide objective information to both consumers and decision makers.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would like to highlight a few points. Decision-making must be clear and transparent. As duplication of the work and of scientific research must be avoided, we need to collaborate with national research institutes and the joint research centres. In addition, food safety is a matter for the entire food sector, from the farmer right down to the consumer. Sound communication between consumers, producers, the retail trade, workers and transporters is crucial. So is attention to diversity in the SMEs. Strict requirements and effective control are indispensable, but competition should be kept clean in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my Committee argues in favour of a strategy for third countries and candidate countries. Food safety is a global task; we should not cut ourselves off from produce from the United States or developing countries. We must work towards a joint agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his willingness to take on board the recommendations from other Committees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reached conclusions similar to those of the committee responsible. We also agree with the Commission's acknowledgement that in the interest of the public, food safety should be given particularly high priority. The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights accordingly made a raft of proposals which are also included in the Bowis report before us.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the limited time available, I propose to cover just two key points. First, there is no doubt that legal provisions in the field of food safety and animal feed safety need to be simplified. We are therefore looking to the European Commission to put forward a basic legal framework. Within this framework, the corresponding legal instruments need to be systematically put in place in such a way that health protection stands out as the most important objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the European public are right to demand that their health be given top priority. Furthermore, they are right to demand that they have an important say, through their Parliament, when food and animal feed safety with a view to protecting their health is at stake. That is why the envisaged European Food Safety Agency can only have Articles 95 and 152 of the EC Treaty as its legal basis, with special attention being paid to its powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are discussing a White Paper and it is useful to define a few first principles. I think we have to be very specific about the role of the future European Food Safety Agency, which is to assess and identify risks in coordination with the existing national agencies. We must make it clear, however, that the rapid alert system and the implementation of the measures must fall within the field of political responsibility. That is where the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament come into play.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is that it is important for this Agency to be highly independent and we must guarantee that independence. It is therefore vital to allow the EFSA to act on its own initiative. It must be independent with regard to the Member States, the European institutions and the agro-food industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled an amendment on levels of risk. I have also had an opportunity to discuss this with Commissioner David Byrne. In some cases we find that the public perceives or imagines risks where these are simply rumours, and it is our duty and responsibility to communicate with the public in order to lay these rumours to rest and restore consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle. Lastly, in the event of a real risk, we must take urgent preventative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the brief of the European Food Safety Agency must be confined to food safety. There is no question of extending it to cover product quality or labelling. We must not confuse food risk assessment with questions of product quality. At all events, the European Parliament and the European Commission are firmly resolved to restore consumer confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, quite often a parliamentary colleague is given a report and you envy him or her. By the time the report is presented you envy them no more. That is not the case with Mr Bowis. He has carried this whole debate through with considerable elegance, charm and willingness to compromise, which is why the committee was able to adopt 12 compromise amendments, supported by almost all the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a stark reminder this week of why we are all here and why this legislation is going through in the report in my own country – the Phillips Committee of Inquiry into the disaster, indeed scandal, of BSE. That came about in our national herd because of negligence and the indictment against those responsible, civil servants as well as ministers, will be set out for the world to see tomorrow. It will not be a day when we look with any particular pride at the procedures we then had. Those procedures have now been amended and changed and we have our own Food Standards Agency. To have such a body introduced in the European Parliament as part of a raft of similar measures, which will increase our concern and care for food safety in the European Union, is a good outcome to what has been a sad tale.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention briefly the key amendments which I commend to the House and the Commissioner and which I hope we can see voted through today. Obviously the title is important and Mr Bowis has accepted that. This has to be called an "authority" because in English and most other languages, that conveys a body which has the power and ability from time to time in the process of risk assessment to use its best judgment and not merely to be the agent of what others would wish it to do. One of the amendments that was passed allowed it to issue own-initiative reports. On the still vexed question of how far we should go in allowing it to look at nutrition, and indeed to offer advice and to be consulted by those whose primary concern is risk management, we have also said that where the issue of safety is involved, these issues also should at least be within the remit of the opinion and the advice of this food standards authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also said that the national food safety agencies and the consumer bodies in the Member States of the European Union should be fully consulted in the processes we are now embarked upon. That is because we need to carry right across the European Union the full support and weight of the public, the stakeholders and indeed, of course, the Member States for this authority. That means that they have to accept that the rapid alert system must be improved immediately and extended to animal feed. Yet again this week we have had another example, with infected beef in France finding its way on to the shelves of <span class="italic">Carrefour</span>, of how hard it is to catch those who have scant regard for food safety issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the EFSA to have a board which has a balanced representation of people in consumer affairs, public health and all possible areas of scientific and agricultural knowledge. We want them to be people whom we can respect and who can declare their interest. Of course many of them will have had links with the food industry, links with science elsewhere. That is understandable and natural, but we need to know how and who and where and we should be able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We want an annual report to this House and we want the director, when he or she is appointed, to be available to the Committee on the Environment and indeed the Agriculture Committee and to this House in general to report back. When that has happened I would say there is one last thing we must do. We must wait patiently for the Commission to come forward with legislation on other matters in the food safety area – PCB standards, food labelling, allergy labelling, action on nutrition policy and the amending legislation we need for processed baby foods and infant formulae. These things are inextricably linked with what the food authority will be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will also be supporting a number of the new amendments, certainly Amendments Nos 11-13, 7-9 and we wish to have a free vote on Amendment No 14. We consider some of the others superfluous, but generally speaking the broad consensus there has been throughout in this House on this report should be carried through into the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, there are a whole lot of important and, on the face of it, conflicting objectives to be achieved in this matter of food safety, including that of safety itself. In this connection, I should like to speak up for cheap food of the kind which families with children buy and which children and young people eat.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned with the freedom to develop food and the food sector and also with the conservation of Europe’s cultural heritage. A central aspect of this is to ensure that the rich heritage of traditions can be preserved. I therefore want to give my support to Amendment No 15.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless believe that one issue has not been properly discussed, namely the need for uniform regulations to be followed up by uniform and thorough supervision. It should not be forgotten that, viewed as a whole, the food sector is the biggest workplace in the European Union. We must ensure that the regulations are complied with in the same way throughout the European Union. Otherwise, we interfere both with safety and free competition in the internal market.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Staes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, “der Mensch ist, was er isst”, you are what you eat. Those, ladies and gentlemen, were indeed the first words I spoke in my maiden speech last year with reference to the Belgian dioxin crisis. Those are also the words with which Mr Bowis began his explanatory statement and speech in this Chamber. This is an immediate sign that Mr Bowis and myself, along with the Environmental Committee, are largely on the same wavelength, and I thank Mr Bowis for the very constructive collaboration of the past few months.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make four observations. The report is right to draw a distinction between risk analysis on the one hand and risk management on the other. It is against this background that I would first of all like to say that food safety guarantees hinge on strict inspections organised by the state, and those inspections are only as strong as the weakest link. If the weakest link breaks, the inspection process will collapse like a house of cards. This means that all inspectorates must work together well and, often, insufficient attention is paid to the inspectorates which inspect animal medicines; this is the pharmaceutical inspectorate in my country. I also regret, therefore, that that inspectorate will hardly be involved – if at all – in the future operation of the European Food Safety Agency. After all, experience has taught us that ineffective inspection of animal medicines and ineffective inspection of the prescribing behaviour of vets can lead to scandals. So I would like to flag this up as an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Bowis report clearly states that the European Food Safety Agency is responsible for risk analysis. We should be very aware that this agency will only be a strong partner in the Food Safety Agency safety debate once it has acquired respectability in the course of the years. This respectability will be gained, not through laws or legislation, but through integrity, academic brilliance, neutrality, duty to be accountable, transparency and comprehensibility. I therefore urge that, when scientific opinions are being weighed up, minority viewpoints also be published each time. After all, science is not something static, it is ever fluid, and the debate on the six American hormones has been sufficient evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the farm to fork approach. I would even go one step further and argue in favour of the seed to spoon approach. That means that when Food Safety Agency safety is examined, all products are taken into consideration, and I would refer to Paragraph 11 of the resolution in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Parliament is right to highlight in Paragraph 17 that the rapid alert system must be extended to cover all food safety aspects, including animal feed. It is only right that we should call for the swift introduction of a positive list, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is only the beginning; we have a long way to go yet. We must realise that consumers must regain their confidence in food and that is a fundamental human right. I hope that in the coming months and years, we will be closely monitoring the Commission during the implementation of the White Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Mr President, I should like to highlight two points here. The subject which we are debating clearly illustrates just how superficial and empty our debate on the political unification of Europe is. This is no paradox. A real food safety agency will never get off the ground, unless of course it has strong political backing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are talking about legislation, initially about application, we are talking about responding to danger, about measures, policy changes and comparing imports – i.e. controlling the safety of products coming in from outside. My question is: who is going to do all this? The national authorities? But the crises which occurred in the past were generally covered up by the authorities in the Member State. Need I remind you of the United Kingdom's policy on BSE? What agency is going to be able to exercise controls, carry out investigations and propose measures on behalf of the whole of the European Union? I, to give a minor example, would love to know what the agency now being proposed would have done about the mad cow crisis in Britain, about the dioxin crisis in Belgium and about the genetically-modified cotton and foodstuffs, such as cotton seed oil, in Greece. Not much, I think.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless this agency comes up to the standards which will give it political teeth, I do not think it will achieve much. The best case scenario is that it will work alongside the Environmental Agency, which does an excellent information job, but which freely admits that the environmental situation in Europe has not improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thomas-Mauro (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is afflicted by serious public health crises at regular intervals. These crises, such as BSE and dioxin, have become a real problem for society and lead to a loss of consumer confidence in the food they eat. The latest events have brought that home to us again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have risen to the situation, like France, which has set up a national food safety agency. Today the European Commission is proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Agency, responsible for analysing all public health risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Sound scientific knowledge is certainly essential to help assess the risks linked to the food chain, from the farm to the table. Any initiative to help identify these risks is therefore a move in the right direction. But is that not approaching the problem the wrong way round? As it often does, the Commission is proposing regulatory measures to remedy or alleviate the adverse effects of a policy for which it is frequently jointly responsible, without in any way questioning its own basic approach. Thus, European requirements relating to traceability, which are good measures, have been made all the more necessary now that we have abandoned checks at our internal or Community borders. Similarly, the European Union is seeking to protect biodiversity and to safeguard ecosystems with its Directives on habitat and on birds, but without questioning the emphasis on high agricultural productivity, which, after all, we know to be the main cause, together with urbanisation, of imbalances in ecosystems.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact it is precisely this emphasis on high productivity that exacerbates food safety risks: the specialisation of farms, most of which practice intensive farming, the need to fall in line with American market prices, and therefore to seek the lowest costs wherever possible, especially for animal feed, the transportation of animals, frequently across great distances, and the various components of the food chain from the farm to the table are all risk factors for public health, yet we prefer to cure the disease rather than prevent it occurring. That is a serious state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, under these circumstances, the European Food Safety Agency has an important part to play in conducting scientific risk analysis. But let us make sure we leave it to the Member States to manage these risks and to apply the precautionary principle in a reasonable and proportionate manner. That will be a guarantee of effectiveness. Indeed, who better than the Member States to carry out adequate local checks? Who better than the Member States to distinguish genuinely dangerous products from those deriving from our different food cultures, even when they pose no health risk at all? Anyway, there is no such thing as a zero risk, nor is it even desirable, given that completely aseptic conditions are no guarantee of food safety. Finally, who better than the Member States to inform the public of the risks linked to this or that product?</p>
<p class="contents">So let us entrust the European Food Safety Agency only with conducting scientific risk analysis, in liaison with our national agencies. Let us require excellence and independence of it. Let us ask it to make recommendations to the political authorities responsible for risk management. And let us not, therefore, give it responsibility for running the rapid alert system and for communication with the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must beware of standardising our food cultures. Each of our countries, and especially France, is proud of its gastronomic culture and local products. That is one of the areas of diversity that makes up the richness of Europe and its quality of life. Let us guard it jealously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Farage (EDD).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is clear that there is considerable enthusiasm for the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it. In the UK, as in many other countries, we have now set up our own agency amidst similar enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">It started work this year and many had high expectations of it. However, with the advent of Mr Byrne's ambitious proposals, it would seem that this national initiative is to be absorbed into the EU structures. In this, we are obliged to Mr Bowis. In his report he confirms the subordinate nature of the British agency when he remarks that "It is essential that the Commission coordinates its various departments including . . . national food agencies." As an aside, I must express my puzzlement about how a Conservative MEP can apparently embrace so easily the absorption of yet another British institution when his party stands on a platform of being opposed to further integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This notwithstanding, it may come as a surprise to Members that I support the concept of a pan-European approach to food safety, which is embodied in the concept of the EFSA. Despite so often being branded as a "little Englander" by my British colleagues, I have no difficulty in acknowledging that germs know no boundaries. However, if germs fail to respect national boundaries, they will, and of course do, fail to respect EU borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, despite the enthusiasm for yet another EU agency, any effective control programme must look beyond the limited vision of a mere 15 states. It must take a wider perspective. In this we are fortunate. Since 1984 we have had the highly effective World Health Organisation's surveillance programme for the control of food-borne infections and intoxications in Europe, based in Berlin at the Von Ostertag-Institut.</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly, unlike the little Europeans who are so often behind this EU project, the WHO's concept of Europe originally embraced 32 countries, which included the former Soviet Union and has since expanded to include all countries from the Urals to the Atlantic, from Iceland to Israel. Not only does the WHO cover Europe it also has a wider remit across the whole planet and this is important. If one charts the progress of the main food-borne diseases which currently affect Europe, most actually made their first appearance in the Americas.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, to name but one, the recent threat of E. coli O157 probably emerged in South America. It then spread to the USA, then to Canada, thence to Australia and Japan, before significant outbreaks occurred in mainland Europe – the first one being in Germany. As a result, many of the control initiatives which have subsequently been adopted in Europe, have originated in other countries, particularly the USA. Risk assessment must start where the problems starts. Therefore, if one acknowledges the need for a transnational agency to bolster the efforts of individual agencies – and indeed I do – then any such agency should not only deal with Europe: it must have a global reach taking in global information. That is precisely what the WHO does for us: working with its regional organisations in a wholly integrated manner. This cannot be achieved by an EU organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the WHO programme remains properly funded and supported, there would appear to be no need whatsoever for yet another agency, especially one with such a limited reach as the 15 Member States of the European Union. Food safety is far too important for it to become yet another excuse for EU integration. It displays the very worst of the European Union, because the perception is one of control freakery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly want to comment on two points. First, the creation of a network amongst Europe's research institutions is absolutely essential if we are to achieve our objective. But we need to avoid a situation in which the future European Food Safety Agency and, for example, the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin have overlapping responsibilities and powers. Not only the Commission, but also every Member State must be legally able to call upon this agency. This makes sense if the European Food Safety Agency is also to be able to operate independently of the Commission and if, whenever necessary, it is to take prompt crisis management action. However, the conditions for appealing to the Agency must be drawn up so that efficient and swift action is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, a universal system for tracing the original ingredients of all food must be created. This principle must be consistently adhered to when the planned review of EU legislation on food labelling is carried out. That is the only way to regain consumers' confidence in food production, which has been destroyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Establishing an efficient and independent European Food Safety Agency is very much to be welcomed, not least because of the various food scandals to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because they want to eat healthily, and we have to ensure that this is possible. The Agency's central tasks will therefore be risk assessment and risk communication, an early warning system with the assistance of the five food committees all working together, excellent public relations work with consumers on food and food safety issues, and optimum networking with scientific institutions and control agencies in the Member States, so as to guarantee controls on the ground from producer to consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to rebuild and strengthen consumer confidence, food safety and regulations need to be taken into account in legislation governing fertilisers, plant health products, medicines, the environment and waste. Reliable risk assessment requires comprehensive analyses and reference measurements. To make scientific results comparable across Europe, the measurement techniques applied need to be standardised and harmonised. An appropriate infrastructure is required for testing food and in particular toxic substances in animal feed. The Joint Research Centre's Health and Consumer Protection Institute is currently also carrying out pan-European quality and safety checks on food, and is amongst other things testing food for contamination and carrying out reference measurements for agricultural products and foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Substantial financial means are needed for all these measures. It is therefore advisable also to involve and take advantage of the European Union's existing institutions, and if appropriate extend them. The funding necessary for this needs to be made available by 2002. I have tabled an amendment on this subject, and I hope you will support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank the rapporteur for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper is by no means an answer to any of the crises. It was high time that the Commission produced the White Paper to follow the Green Paper published many years ago now. It should also be said, as some of the previous speakers have done, and in particular Mr Whitehead and Mrs Gebhardt, that the White Paper is more than just another set of EU rules and regulations. For example, the White Paper must ensure that conditions are created in which safe food is possible at all. If we do not manage to modernise the early warning system and make it work, then there is little point in worrying about much else. If we cannot manage to get the early warning system to emphasise the Member States' responsibility, then we will have a problem. We need to apply stricter legislation, stricter guidelines and stricter criteria to animal feed. Hygiene regulations governing animal feed production, and also regarding checks, need to be much tougher. Without a new framework directive we will be helpless in many areas of food safety. With this in mind, the Commission has presented some 80 proposals – either totally new or proposals for amendments – a very ambitious programme indeed. I can see that in some areas the Commission is already active. I believe that this programme is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are all talking mainly about this new Food Safety Agency. We agreed in committee what this new authority can and cannot do, but I would also like to remind you that food safety is important. We already have scientific bodies in the EU which look after this. However, if we cannot succeed in getting the Member States to actually carry out checks on the spot on the basis of the legislation, if we cannot manage to oblige them to provide information on who checks what, when and how often, then even if we created 20 new authorities in the European Union, not a jot would change as regards food safety. We should not lose sight of that, because in that case, a new authority, whatever it was called, would just be a smokescreen and a token gesture. Some country somewhere would then be happy to provide a home for this new authority, but otherwise nothing would happen. The expressions that then come to mind are "everyone turns a blind eye" or "the dog barks, but the caravan moves on". Hygiene regulations and on-the-spot checks should be the slogan of the hour. And the ones who need to do something about this are not so much the Commission and ourselves, but rather the Member States, who so far have not done their homework.</p>

I am grateful for the constructive cooperation we have had and for the willingness to compromise that has been shown for the purpose of producing a good report. We are now hoping for Parliament’s support, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will accept our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the bureau responsible for food and veterinary issues, other scientific bodies and national authorities, the food authority must create a comprehensive system. Just as Mrs Paulsen said, all Member States and all companies, many of which are multinational, must comply with the legislation. If they do not, there must be a system of sanctions at EU level. I therefore want to discuss Amendment No 16. When food safety is threatened, both public health and the common market are placed in jeopardy. We must consequently make such changes to the EU Treaty as to ensure that the Commission is given the option of imposing sanctions in the area of food, just as it has at present in the area of competition. The food authority ought to be able to propose suitable measures to the Commission in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, he has published a document containing a practical resolution, the justification for which is both humorous and easy to read. It is not often that we read documents such as these here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My group shares the Commission’s and the rapporteur’s view of how the independent Food Safety Agency’s responsibilities are to be apportioned. We believe that its main task must be that of assessing food safety risks and that its core activity must be that of providing scientific advice. Naturally, the legislation must also be strengthened, and caution and responsibility must be the watchwords of everyone without exception, permeating the whole approach to food and enabling the entire food chain to be covered. Food must also, as far as possible, be produced in accordance with ecological principles.</p>
<p class="contents">What we really need is a comprehensive strategy for dealing with food at every stage of its production. We are concerned with issues such as GMOs, additives, labelling and so on. I hope that the Commission will really provide for such a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports most of the amendments. I think that Amendment No 17 is particularly important, stating that the consumer organisations must be consulted. Since recital J states that industry and food producers must be consulted, I believe that a balance is needed in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Optimum food safety standards and falling consumer protection standards cannot be reconciled. So something else is needed here, and I believe that too. But I am in favour of most responsibility remaining with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community is the world's largest importer and exporter of food. This sector has an annual turnover of EUR 600 billion and employs 10 million people. I support everyone involved, be it in a political, administrative or other capacity, who is working on a "food for all" strategy. The developed industrialised nations are also best placed to make the greatest contribution here, through sustainable and varied food production. The White Paper is a political paper for those in positions of responsibility in food production. A zero-risk policy is not really practical. That is why the preventive measures in the White Paper constitute the real action plans. What is more, there is no European flavour here. National peculiarities should not only be respected, but actually encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where the only weak points in the White Paper on food safety lie. Certain questions remain unanswered, such as: what will the relationship be between the Food Safety Agency and consumers? How is it to be financed and how will it cooperate with the Member States? What about liability? Up to now, of course, it has been the innocent parties who have paid. The Commission will have to provide more concrete answers to these questions in its continued work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The usefulness of the authority to be established is undeniable, both in terms of monitoring and in terms of prevention, for which, in any case, the precautionary principle does not provide adequate practical guidance. A reliable legislative framework, the definition of acceptable risk and the practical safeguarding of local food and production diversities are aspects which still require attention, together with those of small and medium-sized businesses and the training of their employees. A further aspect is the organic revision of the labelling rules for both wholesale and retail selling, which will at last provide the consumer with correct information regarding products' traceability and make it possible to identify where responsibility lies in the event of risk or crises.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it has been said, and rightly so, that the authority will not be a political body and that, particularly in the event of a problem arising, it will report to the Commission and the Member States. How this works in practice will become clear when the authority has to act. Its legal status, authority and interaction at European level with other technical and scientific bodies whose responsibilities currently partly overlap with the authority being established also need to be defined.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it will be important to see how its independence and transparency are reconciled with the fact that no current resources have been allocated to it, with its subordination to the Commission, on the one hand, and with its authority to act autonomously and the membership of its board of directors on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the intention to identify priority actions and class them in order of importance is certainly positive. However, while such actions are so long awaiting definition, they do not make up for the need to define a comprehensive European line on food policy and food safety, which will give the many European diversities another opportunity to display their unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not share this viewpoint, for we know that a human being is more than just a body. The fact that food safety rules have been around for a long time is evident from the Bible, as God prescribed these to His people of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is appropriate to qualify the concern which people have with regard to food safety. I would like to counterbalance the quotation from Feuerbach with one from the Lord Jesus himself: “What goes into the mouth does not make anyone unclean; it is what comes out of the mouth that makes someone unclean”, namely what we all say.</p>
<p class="contents">In modern society, the choice of food is enormously varied. We mainly eat tasty food, even if we know it is unhealthy. Strangely enough, however, there is huge panic amongst the public if something goes wrong with food production. In order to win back their confidence, extremely drastic measures are taken, the necessity of which in terms of safety might be questioned. Could a European Food Safety Agency have prevented a dioxin crisis and a BSE crisis?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, drafting new legislation is not the right response to non-compliance with existing legislation. The setting up of independent inspectorates in the Member States which can enforce the law on the spot should therefore be given priority. The same applies to the rapid alert system. Member States need to ensure that this system works well and they need to inform the European Commission in good time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, they enhance the original report of the Committee considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of an independent, high profile European Food Safety Agency is a substantial step which satisfies the need of all the citizens for guarantees on the quality and safety of food products. The neurodegenerative damage to man's central nervous system caused by the consumption of beef or veal – as has been mentioned this morning – from animals suffering from mad cow disease, the recent dioxins alert in Belgium, the high levels of pesticides and herbicides in the environment and the presence of other microbiological and chemical pollutants with potentially cancerous effects arouse in the public a strong sense of alarm and sometimes anxiety. The establishment of a European Food Safety Agency will contribute greatly to achieving a high level of protection of citizens' health.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking all the political groups – the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – for accepting a joint amendment initially tabled by Mr Fiori and myself which gives greater meaning to the very existence of the European authority. It must genuinely be a centre for coordinating the network of national agencies which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions. The purpose of this network of laboratories will be to monitor on a continual, daily basis, the quality and safety of food products – exactly as Mrs Roth-Behrendt said just now – and I agree with this approach. The network must be as close to the citizens as possible and, in this way, their faith will be restored in the European national institutions.</p>

I just hope that it will not also mark the end of the will to intervene rapidly and effectively in a sector which affects the daily lives of the citizens so closely and which is one of the principle benchmarks of our capacity to restore their faith in politics and in the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The impetus will be all the more necessary considering that the great expectations aroused by the White Paper are not, in my opinion, truly reflected in the report tabled by Mr Bowis, despite the considerable amount of work he has put in. Indeed, despite the fact that the creation of the European Food Safety Agency and the definition of its competencies are a fundamental point of the strategy proposed by the Commission, they are not the only point. A European food strategy cannot be reduced merely to the creation of a monitoring authority and the application of a few – albeit necessary – health and hygiene rules. There is an indissoluble relationship between eating healthily and eating well, a relationship of which consumers must be made more aware in order to promote quality and support the typical local products which are one of the great assets of the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With the vote in the Committee on the Environment, we have succeeded in re-establishing a certain balance, including in the scope of the resolution nutrition issues and certain significant references to the role of small and medium-sized businesses in safeguarding diverse dietary habits. That is why I will vote for the report.</p>

Mr Bowis, the fact that it is such a large majority, is partly and mainly thanks to you. You are an extremely skilled diplomat.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not dwell on the heart of the matter, since we are all agreed on that. I would like to bring a few minor aspects to the fore. I have tabled an amendment which is not unimportant, in my view, although Mr Whitehead suggested it was redundant. The authority must be independent and that is why I think that ‘close ties’, as stated in Paragraph 12, should actually not be allowed, not with anybody – not with consumer associations or anybody else. I therefore believe that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly reconcilable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in addition to the authority, there are a number of important things which need to happen. I would single out two of these: we urgently need PCB standards at European level, as well as a positive list of ingredients of animal feed. Commissioner, I would say that there is no time to lose and, ladies and gentlemen, our role in the European Parliament is also vital for, by studying the annual report and interviewing the director of the authority, we will need to ensure that the authority works, because if it does not, if it does not do its work properly, we will end up footing the bill politically speaking. I believe that is something which we will need to keep an eye on in the years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he is pursuing an obvious objective which is – as he says in his document – that of guaranteeing the high levels of food safety that should exist, and a second objective that derives from the first, which is to say that of restoring credibility in the eyes of the consumer, which has been somewhat dented by scandals. I would like to remind you of one that occurred in Spain, the rape seed oil scandal – the consequences of which are still apparent now, after more than 20 years – but also the BSE scandal, the dioxin scandal and the latest worrying scandal in the United States regarding the release, for use in food products, of transgenic sweetcorn that would seem to be unsuitable for consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the rapporteur's proposal to act on three levels is very important. The first level is to create a food authority or agency, founded on the principles of integrity, transparency and independence – independence, amongst other principles, is essential. The second is to introduce clear, accessible priority legislation, and the third is to cooperate with agencies in the other Member States, non-governmental organisations, consumer organisations and international bodies. Therefore, as Mihail Papayannakis said, we too are going to approve and support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I say, by way of a light note, that when I listened to Mr Blokland introducing some biblical quotes I felt he had elevated the status of this debate to a new plane because there were times when we thought that nothing short of divine intervention would help us resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having said that, I believe it is to the credit of this Parliament and Commissioner Byrne that food safety now dominates the European agenda. Our citizens expect and are entitled to a vigilant and positive response. In my view, nothing less will restore consumer confidence in an important policy area both for producers and consumers. We have all learned our lessons from the food crisis of the 1990s. I am confident that by putting in place a systematic set of uniform rules we are laying the groundwork for filling the gaps in the existing legislation. This would clearly enhance food safety through the food chain. The reform of European Union food laws would be carried out at the level of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to avoid a situation where there may be a renationalisation of food purchasing within the European Union. One of the central elements of the reform of the common agricultural policy is to avoid the renationalisation of the CAP in any shape or form. That is why it is so important that food safety laws are enforced at European Union level. For this reason also I welcome one of the core elements in the White Paper on food safety which would lead to the setting up of a new European Food Safety Agency. This authority would have responsibility for scientific evidence and the communication and management of all risks relating to food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which will confront us over the coming months is that of GMOs in food production and we must be open to the potential of biotechnology. In this respect it could be a serious mistake to assume that biotechnology means poor quality or unsafe food. For example, GMO foods offer the opportunity to reduce the levels of pesticide residues and improve nutritional quality, it would be negligent to ignore these advantages. However, I fully support the introduction of clear, non-technical and standardised labelling in the context of GMO food products. Moreover, no food products which are genetically modified or contain genetically modified ingredients should be allowed into the food chain until they are fully tested, and only then with clear labelling specifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, it embodies the commitment to completely and comprehensively overhaul legislation, to set up an independent Food Safety Agency and to organise inspection better.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has symbolic meaning. It can and must signal the start of a new beginning. From now on, the policy will be tackled in a coordinated and integrated manner and will embrace the entire food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that rapporteur Bowis, who has done sterling work, has opted for a positive approach to the White Paper. His report does not so much propose amendments as establish emphases. For example, it is right to stress that the food authority should first and foremost concentrate on food safety. Nevertheless, I hope that there will also be room for collating knowledge in the field of linking food patterns to health. After all, policy should not only focus on preventing damage to health, but also on obtaining health benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">A second justified emphasis is the request for consideration to be given to regional and cultural differences in the food supply and to the role of the SME and the traditional trades in question. I would in this light urge you to recognise the specific value of the SME and traditional trades in the extensive package of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">A third emphasis is required which is as yet missing from the report but which we can introduce via Amendment No 12. Both the White Paper and the Bowis report mention communication on the one hand and procedures in emergency situations on the other, but there is no attention to the internal and external crisis communication which is so desperately needed. It can nevertheless – and we have first-hand experience of this in Belgium – be a determining factor in managing the extent of a crisis and in whether consumer confidence in the institutions survives or not.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let us hope that the Member States might join in the vision shared by Parliament and the Commission, and that, above all, they will assume their responsibility, not only as constituent parts of the Council, but also as a body which must ensure that inspection in the field is carried out efficiently once the European measures have been transposed in national legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, along with many MEPs in the Committee, including myself, have placed the focus on the food authority and this is regrettable to some extent. Regrettable, because good food, safe food particularly benefits from clear legislation. But I also understand that the many crises in Europe, and I also refer to my own country, have shown that we mainly need something to hold on to. The policy needs an anchor so that clear choices can be made and the consumer needs to have confidence. This is why we need this food authority and this is why we are right to set the necessary store by it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for this food authority to be able to function independently. We have spelled this out very clearly in the report, and I am absolutely delighted about it. It is also important for the food authority to be able to prioritise, to work pro-actively and to make recommendations to those who are responsible for risk management. I rather regret that the title only refers to food safety. I can understand if food safety has to be the point of departure, but surely links must be established with other areas, such as the environment, health and such like. I hope that an energetic, future authority can get this dynamic going.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that, at this moment in time, during this political discussion, we should not focus on the place of establishment. I am quite convinced that this leaves the population completely cold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is necessary to move forward swiftly and with flexibility in these matters. This is in the interests of consumers, but also, at the same time, the food chain in Europe. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has now come to adopt a reasonable policy, as there is now the desire to create a scientific, authoritative body from the Food Safety Agency, which would have responsibility for risk assessment and keeping the public informed. It is important that risk management itself will continue to be the responsibility of the Member States and the Commission and thus the object of political supervision also.</p>
<p class="contents">For us to be able to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food and maintain it, the Food Safety Agency must start its work with adequate public resources. Self-sufficiency and the independence of the unit will serve the interests of European consumers best. For that reason it would be best if the agency did not function under the auspices of the Commission but independently and as a body that is physically separate from the Commission. The agency must be located somewhere well-connected in terms of transport and information technology, and the area in question should have a good reputation in the area of food safety. Support from the surrounding scientific community will also be an important factor when choosing a location. For that reason, I support Amendment Nos 14 and 19, which express a desire for principled guidance in deciding a future location. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, the creation of a European Food Safety Agency is a very positive step. However, as some Members have said, we must guarantee its independence. That means providing it with adequate financial and human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we believe that a tax on agro-business profits would be a way of releasing these resources. In order to respect the principle of transparency, we must also authorise the referral of cases to the agency by the unions and the various professional associations, in relation to both consumption and ecology. Sound scientific risk assessment, coupled with an effective strategy of communication with the public, cannot by themselves stamp out the food crises. That is something of a technocratic view, which makes the mistake of overlooking the cultural, social and economic dimensions of food.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a stronger political will to resolve certain crises. Take the current mad cow disease crisis.

I have on many an occasion throughout this process thought that we were lucky when we chose him to draw up the report. He has withstood the pressures he has come up against in this emotional issue extremely well. I would also like to thank Commissioner Byrne for his cooperation. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy followed Mr Bowis’s advice and decided not to adopt a position on the location of the Food Safety Agency. In my opinion, that was a wise policy. It is, however, important to define what we expect from the Food Safety Agency and what sort of criteria should apply in selecting its location. In the interests of the citizens of the Union as a whole, it is to be hoped that these criteria will be implemented. They include good reputation in the field of food safety, independence, and good scientific infrastructure incorporating the best available technology and good transport and telecommunications links. Amendment No 19, which I together with Mr Nisticò and Mr Fiori, as well as many others, tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, states these criteria clearly without taking a stand on any particular location. These criteria will all be essential tools in realising the common aim to restore consumer confidence in European food safety as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In talks, there has been a call for the agency to be located in a city in which one of our Institutions is located, as, otherwise, it could not be supervised. This sort of argument is puzzling and worrying and in fact removes the foundations on which the idea of integration is built. I do not think we can in all seriousness say that only an authorised body that is located in the midst of the Community can reliably carry out the task it is entrusted with. There must be other reasons for the euro’s low value than the fact that the European Central Bank is situated in Frankfurt. I myself do not think this way and trust in the strength and basic principles of European integration throughout the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The White Paper on food safety is a proposal which aspires to restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain. Consumers are quite right to demand food which poses absolutely no threat to their health and the quality of which meets certain criteria and specifications. Consequently, legislation on food issues should cover the entire spectrum and extend horizontally. Allow me to highlight a number of points. The early warning system has proven to be less than efficient and the Member States bear a great deal of the responsibility for this. I think there should be specific deadlines by which the European Commission must be notified if there is any cause for concern. Stricter, more efficient controls are needed in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Food Safety Agency is concerned, the fact that it is independent should be highlighted; then it will be able to assess any imminent risk and propose measures for managing the risk and helping to shape final political decisions. Similarly, the Agency should ensure that there is transparency by giving all interested parties access to information.

Winning back the public’s confidence in food safety is more important than for food safety alone. After all, this is about the confidence of the citizen in the government.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the new European Food Safety Agency must become a powerful and independent body which does not only inform the public but is also given specific powers to propose effective measures in good time and to investigate problems in the event of a crisis. We therefore have an organisation in mind which is as slim as possible, and not a large bureaucracy. In addition, part of the body’s efficiency will consist of transparent decision-making and the swift publication on the Internet of its studies and recommendations, as happens with, for example, the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin, which is running extremely smoothly. The public is entitled to this. It is also important to build on the work of existing organisations, such as EMEA and FAO, because duplication must be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Government should not escape its responsibility. In the final analysis, decisions must be taken by the European Commission, and Parliament must, for example by means of a discussion on the annual report, remain involved in the work of the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, President Prodi created huge expectations in the run-up to his presidency, and Commissioner Byrne and rapporteur Bowis were asked to flesh these out in their White Paper. I believe they succeeded in this extremely well, and we shall now welcome legislation in this field as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My compliments to him and indeed to our rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for a very logical and rational approach to the problem before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must have the highest possible standards of food safety for its citizens. Food safety and public health are key political priorities. We must be able to trust those who set out to advise us – farmers, food manufacturers, processors, retailers, government, consumer advisory groups, scientists, an endless list. It is essential that we have a body of science as a reference point, whether we are consumers or policy-makers or even contributors to the food chain, and that we know what is an acceptable balance between risk prevention and informed consumer choice – it is all about balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety and security does not mean sacrificing choice, or indeed cultural diversity, and one of the most interesting amendments of the Committee on the Environment, which supplements and strengthens the report, is on the preservation of the European cultural heritage with regard to local food specialities.</p>
<p class="contents">Risks therefore need to be identified early, assessed scientifically and nipped in the bud. European action is appropriate because in a single market risk does not stop at national borders. The EFSA should play an important role in the existing Rapid Alert System, which should be improved and extended to cover all areas of food safety, including animal feed. I welcome the fact that there is broad agreement on the main principles: that a new scientific body responsible for food safety risk assessment should be established, that it should be independent, accountable, transparent and subject to the needs of objective research and of commercial confidentiality and that it should provide the public with accessible and comprehensible information. Most important of all, it should gain the respect of its peers, the confidence of the public and the willingness of Member State governments to accept its conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The limited quantity of food we still allow ourselves must first and foremost be healthy, taste good and be produced in an environmentally sound way in consumers' eyes. There are many aspects that need to be addressed in talking about food safety and if we want to guarantee it. There are already very many organisations and institutions, not to mention associations and initiatives, concerned with food safety. In the European single market, which implies free trade and movement of goods, we are increasingly faced with the issue of legislative jurisdiction and responsibility for controls in this area, which is so important for the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Agency. I welcome this proposal, but at the same time I have certain questions about the powers, remit and influence of a European authority. These are the same questions that we considered in committee. I would therefore like to compliment Mr Bowis on his excellent and well-balanced report, in which he has brought together a wide variety of ideas. The Agency's responsibility should be for risk assessment. It should carry out assessments and work with bodies in the Member States. Transparency is particularly important, and is required by the public. They want to be kept informed. That is why the Agency has to ensure that the public has easily accessible and understandable information. The Agency is intended to work closely with existing institutions, but that also means that information, statistics and data should also be mutually accessible. Other people's experience and findings can be pooled with our own, and findings can be assessed at pan-European level. We do not want everyone reinventing the wheel. But we can also learn from each other's experience here. That is how I see the future role of a Food Safety Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard various fine phrases quoted about diet. Let me offer one more: variety in moderation. The selection found on overflowing shelves has long since made this a genuine option. But the creation of a new authority or agency cannot change the eating habits of many members of the public, or the way we prepare and store food, or people's inadequate knowledge about preparing a balanced diet. Making food safer does not remove the need for consumers to act responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne, it sounds to me as if we will have fewer and fewer producers but more and more inspectors. I am worried that Europe is again in danger of creating an overblown bureaucracy that is incapable of taking action. How exactly will the Agency's powers be divided with national inspection authorities? I am concerned that this will be another millstone round our necks. This new authority will not strike a blow for freedom in terms of consumer policy. Who will be suing whom in future food scandals?</p>
<p class="contents">We are always discussing the division of powers in the context of enlargement of the European Union. But this concept also plays a key role in food safety. Strict application of the "polluter pays" principle will remain essential in repairing economic damage in future. The consistency of the White Paper on food safety leaves something to be desired in places. The timetable for achieving its objectives varies greatly according to the wishes of many stakeholders. So we will not stand in the way of establishing this body any more with today's debate. However, I do believe that we should not raise our hopes too high by imagining that this body will be a cure for all ills in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I intend to ask whether those cards should have been dealt at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and over in this House we discuss the details of proposals which have been put before us but we fail to ask whether those proposals should be there at all. We already have food safety agencies in most Member States. We have scientific committees advising the Commission. We have the World Health Organisation in Geneva. What will a European Food Safety Agency add? It will largely duplicate the activities of existing agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Its main function is public relations. It is driven by the desperate need to persuade a sceptical public that the European institutions are delivering something – anything – of value. Would the new agency have prevented the British BSE crisis or the Belgian dioxin crisis? As Mr Blokland rightly says, almost certainly not.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to recognise the law of diminishing returns. As we create new levels of bureaucracy and spend ever more money we get less and less in return. We are told we cannot question the value of money spent on human health. Yet, as politicians allocating finite resources, we must ask these questions. Would the vast cost of this new agency be better spent on cancer research or smoking prevention or road safety? Almost certainly these areas would deliver better value in terms of lives saved, yet no one is prepared to ask the question.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the question of location for the agency. In my view its main task should be to coordinate better the work of existing agencies. The heads of national agencies should constitute its board. These people should continue to sit at their own desks, in front of their own computers. The location of the agency should therefore be not in Barcelona, Helsinki or Italy, but on the Internet, in cyberspace. It would be efficient, transparent and accessible. This would be a truly twenty-first century solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, there are good reasons why we asked for this paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there have been very different approaches, as the discussions in recent months have demonstrated. That is why the rapporteur deserves great praise, because he has managed to pull together very different approaches and ideas into a clear report. There have even been widely conflicting views about the main point of the White Paper, the creation of a Food Safety Agency. I will not deny that when the White Paper was published, I spoke out against the Agency. If when it comes to the vote I – and I expect a substantial majority – argue in favour of this Agency, I would nevertheless advise the Commissioner not to be deceived. There are many doubts and critical voices. You should take Parliament's proposals seriously and concentrate the Agency's work on scientific tasks and risk analysis. I particularly wish to stress that the Agency and the present system of advisory committees cannot exist side by side. There must be clear arrangements governing the Agency's cooperation with the Joint Research Centre in Ispra and the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin. You must prevent several institutions carrying out similar work in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the actual structure of the Agency, it must be clear how it is to be financed. We in Parliament welcome and wish to encourage a financing plan. What staff numbers are required? What is an appropriate timetable for setting up an authority of this kind? You should also use the White Paper to enforce strict rules in the Member States. If the proposals for over 80 legislative measures are much the same as the hygiene rules I have now received as rapporteur, then I am very optimistic. However, Commissioner, when it comes to the provisions on labelling, please think again about your ideas …</p>

I must say, among other things, that we have recouped an extremely important aspect, the concept of a European Food Safety Agency as a network that should complement rather than replace the food safety bodies of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also necessary to call for a balanced approach to the issue because Articles 152 and 153 of the Treaty on European Union provide, as a general rule, for a high level of protection of human health and of consumers. The priority of absolute concern for humans is based on these principles. We must therefore ensure that the European Union has the highest possible food safety standards, but in taking this approach – which we unanimously uphold – we must also analyse the economic implications for the sectors involved in production. Article 2 of the Treaty states that the Union is committed to promoting the harmonious, balanced, sustainable development of economic activities. Therefore, any legislative measure concerning a sector such as the food sector, which is one of the driving forces of European industry – accounting for 15% of the total output of the manufacturing sector and employing 2.5 million workers – must be evaluated on the basis of this twin consideration, since both principles are intended to guarantee the general well-being of the Community. Any consumer protection operation only becomes feasible in terms of profit when it avoids unduly damaging the general economic well-being of the Community through placing disproportionate barriers in the way of the sector's production processes and therefore hampering economic growth and growth in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the Commissioner to avoid excessive legislation and bureaucratic burdens as far as possible, particularly where small and medium-sized businesses are concerned.</p>

We must, however, ensure that in the wake of the debate on the White Paper, the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which concerns itself with the quality of products without doing anything effective to combat fraud that threatens the health of the consumer is not reinforced in the mind of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, congratulate Mr Bowis on his report and I would just like to highlight one point. A strategy which covers the entire food chain, from farming to production and distribution, could facilitate further economic concentration to the detriment of smaller companies and companies producing typical products, without creating any real advantage for the consumers. Small companies producing typical products are the jewel of many European regions. The objective of food safety can and must fit in with this grass-roots situation which, as a large number of Members have stressed, is of cultural as well as economic value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very loaded topic which, after the European food crisis, has led to heated debates, and Mr Bowis managed very well to incorporate this debate in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, the debate has focused on a European Food Safety Agency, which could be seen as Europe’s answer to the American FDA. In fact, that is how it was launched by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, when he took up office.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper which is now before us and the Bowis report both take an agency as their only starting point, an agency attended by an extensive package of tasks in the form of accompanying legislative measures designed to restore confidence. Upon careful examination of the White Paper in the Member States and here in Parliament, it will then be given legislative status in the form of a new draft directive. The tasks will then involve independent scientific research, advice, independent inspections and a rapid alert system, but definitely coordination too, in order to restore confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I have concerns regarding those independent inspections. Why? In my view, there should be better guarantees for coordination with Dublin, and it should also be possible to carry out inspections in the Member States without prior permission. Amendments have been tabled to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation, standards and laying down rules remain within the remit of those institutions authorised for those purposes in Europe. Those are the Commission, as initiator, and the Council and Parliament as legislator. That does not take away the fact that I am left with one huge wish. I would have liked so very much to have drawn a comparison with the EMEA, and I also wanted to include notification and product approval as part of an agency’s remit. I hope that this will be given due consideration in the new proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you are aware, the Commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety. I must give special thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and its rapporteur, John Bowis, for producing this opinion with such a degree of consensus and pay particular tribute to him and to the other Members of this House who have taken the time to discuss these issues with me and with my officials. The consequence is that we have achieved this excellent measure of consensus which is yet another notable example of the cooperation that can exist between our two great institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's White Paper on food safety sets out a major and ambitious programme of legislative reforms to complete the EU's farm to table policy. Taken together with our proposals to establish a European Food Safety Agency, the programme will make a major contribution to the health protection of our citizens as well as to the restoration and maintenance of consumer confidence in food safety. European consumers have every right to expect the highest achievable food safety standards and our ambition is to develop systems that deliver this.</p>
<p class="contents">A food safety chain from farm to fork, correctly regulated and effectively controlled, is the road to building high levels of confidence in the European food supply. In this respect the Commission is already hard at work on its programme of legislative reform set out in the White Paper. Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament: for example, the package of proposals recasting and updating the hygiene legislation. As an aside, I can say of the speakers who referred to the need for sensitivity in relation to the promotion of local food specialities and traditional foods that this issue is addressed in the hygiene legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also working on a number of major reforms in the systems of control implemented by the competent authorities in the Member States and at Community level. In this regard, the Commission will adopt proposals for a revised control regime in the period ahead. The White Paper reiterates the Commission's commitment to basing its proposals for consumer health protection measures on sound science. Indeed, the food authority is conceived as a point of scientific excellence at the service of the Community in its broadest sense: consumers, the institutions and Member States alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The food authority will also need to be visible to the general public and be the authoritative voice in matters relating to the scientific aspects of food safety in Europe. The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the overarching principles and objectives of food law, which will provide the framework for future health protection measures relating to food. This proposal will put forward the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency which will provide the Community with advice on scientific and technical issues and thereby enable the Commission to give effect to the general principles of food law. Our intention is to adopt this proposal in the Commission on 8 November 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This schedule continues to reflect the importance the Commission attaches to the matter and is broadly in line with the timescale set out in the White Paper which envisages that the establishing legislation will be enacted in 2001, leading to the establishment of the food authority in 2002. I only wish we could do better in terms of time. I know, Mr President, that you share my views in this regard. I look forward to the fullest support from Parliament in dealing with this most important piece of legislation in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have followed Parliament's debate on the White Paper with great interest. I am encouraged to note the high degree of agreement between Parliament's views as expressed in the draft report that you have debated, and the White Paper itself. This will facilitate the Commission's task in bringing forward a balanced proposal that takes maximum account of the views of Parliament and the many stakeholders in the area of food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">You will appreciate that I cannot promise to take on board all your views, but my record before this Parliament will demonstrate that I will do my utmost. I have previously acknowledged in Parliament and other forums what I regard as an important issue for the fullest acceptance of our ideas for a food authority: the role and involvement of Parliament itself in enacting the legislation establishing the food authority. I would like to put it on the record today that I remain committed to Parliament having a full codecision role in the enactment of this legislation. It is right and proper and I support Parliament's desire to see Articles 95 and 152 of the Treaty employed to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation to you, Mr President, your rapporteur, Mr Bowis, the shadow rapporteurs, the Committee on the Environment and the other committees who have contributed, and the House as a whole for bringing to a close this chapter in our collective endeavours towards improving Europe's food safety regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
