<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in 1995, the Commission submitted the communication on the development of short sea shipping on the basis of the strategy which was formulated in the White Paper on the common transport policy. The second annual progress report on this draft is now before us. However, after five years, it has become clear that short shipping is still merely an empty promise which has not been kept, despite the verbal support by the Transport Council of 8 December 1999, which considered short sea shipping as a priority. </p>
<p class="contents">We are not trying to boost the popularity of short sea shipping out of idealistic motives. It is a fact that transport shipping will increase by 70% in the next decade. It is impossible to meet this growing demand by road transport alone. Short sea shipping is therefore not a competitor of road transport, the train or transport using inland waterways, it is one of the modes in the transport chain. It is in everyone’s interest to keep the irritation communities are caused by the constant drone of through freight transport to a minimum. </p>
<p class="contents">Transport should also be as clean as possible and in that respect too, short sea shipping meets high requirements. Speed might not be the main feature of short sea shipping, safety is. Weekend traffic bans and traffic jams are a curse to road transport. In many cases, short sea shipping can provide a solution to these problems if it is used in combination with other modes of transport. At the same time, I do not want to claim here that it is a panacea. </p>
<p class="contents">We will take the pressure off quite substantially if we try to make the best use of all modes of transport and combine them in the best way we can. But in order to do this, a number of conditions do need to be met. </p>
<p class="contents">In its communication, the Commission makes a distinct reference to industry itself. This is fine, but as rapporteur, I would like to add another dimension. There are some very specific aspects where mainly governments at national, local or regional level can add weight and can give short sea shipping a boost. </p>
<p class="contents">In its communication, the European Commission provided a sound overview of the issue as a whole. Parliament and your rapporteur have looked at the Commission plans with a critical eye and tried, in consultation with all parties involved, as befits a Parliament, to compile this report. Industry was asked to raise practical issues which could, in their view, obstruct the development of short sea shipping. We are still awaiting this report. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline a few aspects. Once again, short sea shipping can only take off in Europe if it is considered an integral part of the transport chain. Connections with the hinterland in the form of rail, internal waterways and road are essential in this respect. As such, it is important that short shipping is integrated with other modes of transport and this means that infrastructure will need to meet certain requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">Short sea shipping is also eminently suited to specialist transport. Cars are a good example of this. Innovation in the construction of specialist ships will prove decisive here and this could give our shipbuilding industry a shot in the arm. </p>
<p class="contents">The sector’s image is also important and must clearly be cleaned up. The sector is suffering from excessive red tape. Procedures last forever. But increasingly, we can also point to many positive developments within the sector. Industry should take its responsibility there, for example, in the setting up of regional promotion and marketing agencies, but the market cannot do this on its own. Member States must lift obstructions. For example, the road transport monopoly springs to mind, with the impact this has on the levels at which short sea shipping should pitch its prices to tie in with Bilbao’s short sea port. </p>
<p class="contents">At every level, excessive bureaucratic procedures and endless red tape accompany the cargo. This puts short sea shipping at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly Parliament calls for this sector to be treated with the necessary flexibility, thus enabling this sector to acquire a better position in terms of affordability. For example, we have in mind the introduction of exemptions from pilot service in ports where captains can demonstrate they have a high level of experience. By the way, an irritating error has crept in to the <span class="italic">erratum</span>, where the experience of the <span class="italic">pilot</span> is referred to. This should, of course, be the <span class="italic">captain</span>, otherwise this is complete nonsense. </p>
<p class="contents">The market is still fragmented at present. This is why in its report, Parliament points to the need for a one-stop-shop approach to offering logistical transport services to end users. These services should embrace all multi-modal transport services and should, in this way, counteract the fragmentation of the present services. </p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I also call for incentives from the Commission, which are needed to promote short shipping. In view of the European connections, I would also ask for investment projects in mainly the Mediterranean Sea area and the ports along the Adriatic Sea. Short sea shipping requires destinations. You may have wonderful short sea terminals in Rotterdam, but you need to have a destination. The setting up of these new lines requires critical mass and it could be one or two years before these resources are available. The European Union will need to help out by providing cheap loans from the European Investment Bank in order to overcome this difficulty. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are lacking information and statistical data on which industry can base its investments. No one knows what we transport in what way, where to and in what quantities. I believe that statistical data on what we transport where is one of the things we need as a matter of urgency in order to pursue a policy for transport, which will grow at an amazing rate in the next couple of years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ojeda Sanz (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues Ripoll and Pérez Álvarez, who have worked on this report – but who are not able to be here – I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, on her marvellous report, in particular because it deals with a problem which is important for very real and practical reasons. Furthermore, I wish to say that there are two things which I am regretting right now: firstly, that I am not able to hear the opinion of our friend Mr Fatuzzo on how short sea shipping affects the interests of European pensioners, and secondly, that so few Members are present because, considering the egotistical interests of this House, it is probable that one day they will regret not having found out about the issue of short sea shipping, because they will perhaps have to use it one day to travel to and from Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the background to the issue, I must tell Mrs Peijs that we have followed with great interest the developments and actions which in recent years, especially on the basis of the creation of the forum for the maritime industries, have been taking place in the European Union with a view to promoting short sea shipping as an alternative to land transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission’s report and the rapporteur’s report illustrate the different comparative advantages of each type of transport, of which, in the case of sea transport, I would like to highlight the fact that the infrastructures are less saturated, the fact that they are less expensive, they consume less energy and therefore emit fewer pollutants into the atmosphere and they improve communications with the outermost regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider – and I think we all agree on this – that the transfer of charges from land to sea transport should be taken as a priority objective of the European Union’s transport policy. I would like to highlight the fact that in the last two years there have been a series of actions which have had positive effects on short sea shipping. This has made it possible, as the Commission’s report points out, for intra-Community sea transport activity to increase by 23% between 1990 and 1997. Nevertheless, this is a relatively modest increase – of only 3% cumulatively per year – and this is less comparatively than the increase over the same period in land transport, which has been 26%. Consequently, rather than bringing the relative positions of sea transport and road transport closer together, the difference between them has continued to increase. All of this indicates therefore that we not only need more vigorous quantitative measures but that we probably need a different qualitative focus.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs’s report seems to us to be very balanced, but we would like to draw your attention to one of the key objectives for the promotion of short sea shipping: the simultaneous reduction of the time and direct cost involved in port operations for ships which provide this type of service. In many cases, the port services – both with regard to the ship and the goods – are faced with no effective competition or with very limited competition and this means that there is often abuse of dominant positions, such as the imposition of obligatory services which are not necessary or are not even used, for example, piloting, towing, mooring and port handling, as well as the payment of very high tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certainly the case is that, apart from very few exceptions, transoceanic services do not have to face competition from roads and, in most cases, air transport does not offer any practical competition to them.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we believe that, if the intention is to promote short sea shipping in a realistic and effective way, it is essential to reorganise the current provision of port services, by improving their efficiency and reducing their costs. We should also bear in mind what this means for the economies of the areas in which there is a ship-building industry. This means a revitalisation of the whole area, as is well known by the people who live in those cities, in those regions, in which the ship-building industry is a very active element in the local economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The answer is: we have a vision. We see large quantities of goods transported round our continent on safe, environmentally-friendly ships. The goods are unloaded at the point where they can reach their destination via the shortest possible overland route. That takes the burden off overland transport by adding another link to the chain of intermodal transport. Of course we are still many sea miles away from making this vision come true, although some progress has been made over the past two years, as the report shows.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs’ good report describes the existing obstacles and the strategies for realising our visions. There was broad agreement in committee. What can we do internally for short sea shipping? I just want to mention a few things. In the technical field we can introduce more environmentally-friendly technology for ships’ engines and specific terminals for express transhipment. In the organisational field, and especially for cross-frontier transport, we can introduce uniform shipping documentation, simplified administrative procedures and fewer pilot services in cases where they are not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do for short sea shipping as a link in the intermodal chain? First, we can improve the interfaces with other modes of transport by introducing modern systems of transhipment – especially to inland shipping – standardising containers, promoting transport logistics services for the entire transport chain and by many other means mentioned in the report. I think we should also consider all these matters with a view to our pre-accession strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables. The report says that an exchange of best practice would be useful. That is true, for why have we been calling for some time now for a reference centre for intermodal transport. It would be sensible to engage in more research and above all to set up demonstration projects in the field of intermodal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all the report offers a whole package of sensible proposals. I hope that the next progress report in two years’ time will tell us that we have moved a little closer to our vision, our vision of a successful intermodal transport system in Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although these come from my own constituency, I know they are representative of many similar regions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, intermodality and the need to optimise infrastructure links to the hinterland. This week we have voted for environmentally-friendly measures designed to encourage more freight on to rail. Good rail access into ports is vital in this context. We have to accept, however, that there are times when it is roads that provide the necessary access into the hinterland. I cite the placing on the TENs map of the A75 from Gretna to Stranraer, given its importance for sea transport to and from Northern Ireland. Second, the extent to which outlying regions and islands depend on the sea for contacts with their neighbours. We often look on the sea as something that separates communities. We are better viewing it as a highway that connects them.</p>
<p class="contents">My group endorses Amendments Nos 1 and 4 accordingly. I would add, though, that for environmental sustainability we should look upon connections between peninsulas in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">In the west of Scotland the route from Gourock to Dunoon is twenty times as far by road as it is by sea and that from Tarbert to Portavadie is twenty five times as far. Third, it is essential that we continue to recognise the lifeline nature of many short sea shipping routes. I am not thinking just in terms of the need to sustain public service obligations in this context. We also need to find other permissible ways of reducing the costs associated with transport to island and outlying communities. Their economies are invariably fragile ones and it is just not good enough that the farmers on the Isle of Lewis have to pay twice as much for their hay as farmers living near Inverness. I hope the Commission will take such points into serious consideration when developing policy in the area.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed true that short sea shipping is environmentally friendly and cost-effective, and it is indeed true that it supports the economic development of maritime regions; but we in Scotland call upon the Commission, therefore, to get its act together in respect of the forthcoming liberalisation of sea transport in the west of Scotland.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Attwooll has just pointed out, we not only have island transport there but also important short sea links across what we call sea lochs and the geologists call fjords, where instead of going 150 kilometres up a narrow road over a mountain pass, you can take a boat across a narrow water.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to interpret the regulation on maritime cabotage sensibly, we would say: Of course these peninsulas are functionally equivalent to islands, and public service obligations apply in these cases as well. In that case it would be quite lawful for the state to support the services there. In the same way, one could then take a holistic look at the package of routes across the west of Scotland, instead of breaking it up, inviting cherry-picking by private entrepreneurs who come in to take the few paying routes and make it harder to sustain the routes which are not profitable all the year round. We want a holistic look at that kind of thing throughout Europe, we want an imaginative approach by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is six weeks since I put a question to the Commission asking if it would treat the peninsulas as equivalent to islands. Earlier it had claimed intimate knowledge of the west of Scotland. It still have not replied to that. I ask it to reply as a matter of urgency.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development and promotion of short sea shipping are a particularly important step on the way to developing a system of multimodal transport for the European Union and bordering regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Efficiency, cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility and sustainability distinguish this form of transport from road transport and can offer a serious alternative in coastal regions. However, it is also most important to improve the cooordination between the various modes of transport so as to bring out the specific strengths of each of them most effectively. That is why the public and private sector must adopt a range of European, national and regional aid measures to adapt and develop the ports, which are the nerve centre of the transport chain, and target these measures at the specific requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore; it is important to adapt the related technical and organisational aspects, such as administrative formalities and documents, customs and embarkation procedures, to ensure the rapid and smooth change from one mode of transport to another and from one country to another. Other support measures should include special incentives for the development of innovative technologies, special pre-embarkation terminals for short sea shipping and integrating the ports in the development strategy for the coastal regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important means of strengthening economic and social cohesion and the links between the centres and the peripheral areas in the European Union. The integration of short sea shipping in the logistics chain of door-to-door delivery can be an effective means of sustaining the growing economic cooperation between the EU and its neighbouring states and satisfying the growing need for transport that accompanies it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transport policy requires choices. Sustainable transport policy requires even more, or at least other, choices. The task which we in this House have is to facilitate the transport of goods and passengers in such a way as to keep adverse side-effects to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">The mode of transport we are discussing here, short sea shipping, has the reputation of being a mode of transport which can counter the negative effects of the transport sector, especially in terms of the space occupied and environmental pollution, in more than one way. However, as Mrs Peijs rightly points out, the sector is not taking full advantage of the opportunities at the moment. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a number of aspects. </p>
<p class="contents">We often hear that short sea shipping, and transport by sea in general, is an environmentally friendly mode of transport in terms of emissions per transported unit. This is certainly true, relatively speaking. However, progress made in this sphere in other sectors, especially road transport, is undermining this position. If ports refuse to turn a ship, swift action is most definitely required. Given the developments in the road transport sector as a result of new European emission standards for fuels, I am of the opinion that in order to boost the environmental performance of short sea shipping, we need to lay down a European directive concerning maximum permitted emission levels generated by ships’ engines. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, unlike certain fellow delegates, I am of the opinion that short sea shipping should not only supplement existing modes of transport, it should also operate as an alternative to intra-Community transport. Given the problems surrounding distribution or with regard to reducing ECO points in Austria, we very much welcome an alternative route from North to South and vice versa. Short sea shipping can take care of at least part of this. </p>
<p class="contents">A third aspect concerns the situation at ports. If we want short sea shipping to become more competitive in terms of speed, we will need measures to simplify customs and (dis)embarkation procedures. The rapporteur is right to point this out. </p>
<p class="contents">If the sector then operates more efficiently and according to more up-to-date standards, it is vital to broadcast its potential. In a number of countries, including the Netherlands, promotion offices have been set up successfully with this goal in mind. It is therefore advisable for national or regional authorities to do their bit in order to develop this sector. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mrs Peijs’ report is comprehensive and I would like to congratulate her on this. If those involved take up their responsibilities, we are bound to conclude in a number of years what the Netherlands already knows: “Transport by sea, the best route”! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But for those who live and make their living there, the island shipping services are both an essential lifeline and a costly hurdle to be overcome for their economic and social well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">The costs that impede are not only the fares, difficult as those often are, but also the inconvenience of pre-booking, of waiting in queues, of fitting in with timetables which provide low and variable frequencies; and then there are the risks of delays and cancellation due to weather or mechanical breakdown, or strikes which hold the islands to ransom from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is considerable concern on the Scottish islands at the moment that the EU's competition policy, which requires putting these services out to competitive tender, will undermine these lifeline services even at their present level and add a further upward ratchet to the cost of living and of doing business. We need to reassure those who live and work on these vulnerable islands and remote peninsulas that they have nothing to fear from bringing a measure of competition into the process for awarding these contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I ask the Commission to do what it can to reassure the Scottish islands, the Scottish executive that is struggling with this situation at the moment and the Scottish Parliament, that it stands ready to make sure that this process works well, that it does not undermine but improves the shipping services in the Scottish islands. Perhaps through Commission Verheugen I can pass an invitation to the Transport Commissioner, his colleague, Mrs de Palacio, to accompany me on a romantic trip to the Scottish islands.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the basic sector is passenger transport, but the report under discussion focuses on freight transport in response to the Commission's communication.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that, although the volume of traffic carried by this form of transport has risen over recent years, road transport has fared better, meaning that special attention needs to be given to this more environmentally-friendly form of transport. The current situation is still pretty off-putting for the public, which is given the impression that this is a fairly outdated, slow and complicated means of transport. The development of maritime transport is further hampered by administrative procedures in need of improvement and delays, an incomplete infrastructure and the obscure fees levied by some ports, together with unnecessary mooring charges. But we can still improve its image and turn it into a viable alternative solution for types of freight which can be transported by various methods. I refer, of course, to places which are not restricted to maritime transport, such as islands, which must always warrant special attention. The private sector has a basic role, but there are aspects of the market which call for intervention by public-sector agencies at regional, national and European level and even financial aid, so that islanders do not feel that they are second-class Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing cabotage has an immediate impact on social and economic development in our regions and hence on the cohesion of the European Union. The rapporteur has obviously approached the subject matter in this spirit and has taken her work very seriously; as an islander I feel obliged to extend her my special thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen who, I see, has put his headphones on. Thank you for your attention earlier on during the explanations of vote by the honourable members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As always, I would like to remind you that the regional and structural policy of the Union, as a whole, is a response to the specific disadvantages suffered by certain European regions, such as the so-called outermost regions.

<p class="contents">Therefore, we believe that Mrs Peijs’s report is opportune, especially if it is reinforced by the amendment I have presented on the inclusion of sea transport between ports in the outermost regions and ports in the vicinity of those regions. In this way, we could correct the error made by the Commission when it drew up the two-yearly report on the development of this type of transport, of employing an incomplete definition of short sea shipping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mrs Peijs for her interesting and excellent proposal. In my own country, shipping is almost totally of this short sea shipping type: in other words, it is important to us in that respect. We are unusual in that we only have a land connection with the rest of the EU in the north, so the importance of maritime traffic is enormous. On top of everything, our railways have a different gauge from those found elsewhere in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is most peculiar about our situation is, however, that our shipping always comes to a halt in the winter unless certain measures are taken, because the sea freezes. This has led to a situation where we have had to establish a special fleet to break the ice. They are powerful ships: one ship’s energy is equivalent to that used by a whole city. This being the case – as we have this hindrance to movement – we hope that this ice-breaking operation may be supported, as the obstacle has been ordained by the Lord, and we cannot do a thing about it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also to be regretted that the effects on employment and welfare of this sort of traffic have not been highlighted sufficiently. A cheap workforce is a huge risk in these circumstances, especially in the north, and especially in ice. How can someone wearing shorts, who has no professional skill to his name, cope in minus thirty degrees and three metres of ice? That is the problem. Aircrews are always well trained, but the same cannot be said of the cheap workforce that is employed on ships. I expect the Commission to look into this matter.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This week here in Parliament there have been many important reports on the subject of transport, all aimed at relieving congestion and reducing bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs’s splendid report aims at exploiting the opportunities offered by short sea shipping. It is an important addition to the reports on railways and air traffic.

Quite clearly she has spent a lot of time on it and has brought a lot of problems to light.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see the different problems quite clearly from different areas of the European Union. Each area has its own particular problem. We have to recognise that it will take time to achieve our ultimate goal. But there is no doubt that short sea shipping is something we must strive to achieve better than we have up to now. It is certainly sensible to ship more goods by sea rather than by road. It is more environmentally friendly, more acceptable in every way. But we have to ensure that we get the balance right. That is what the rapporteur has been striving for.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the greatest problems will always be the cost factor. To be competitive ports have to be more efficient and for this they will certainly require more support.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Mrs Attwooll's appeal for the A75. It recognises that we in Northern Ireland export goods across what is a very expensive stretch of water between Northern Ireland and Scotland. It is our main outlet for all we produce. From Scotland they trundle down to England. There certainly could be a more efficient and environmentally satisfactory way of doing that but there is no cheaper way. For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost-effective.</p>

All the previous speakers have said this, and, like you, regretted the fact that short sea shipping suffered from such a poor image in terms of its slowness and inefficiency, even though it provides one solution to traffic congestion, high infrastructure and environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in recent years, this form of transport has enjoyed an unquestionable success, even though it is not very well known, or not well enough. It does however offer, as you said, advantages in terms of costs, energy, efficiency, regional cohesion, the environment and even intermodality, as it is an ideal means in the implementation of multimodal transportation. Measures must therefore be taken at the earliest possible opportunity to step up the efficiency of dockside operations and reduce waiting times in port. Speaking personally, I would insist on the public authorities playing a part, at regional as well as national and European levels.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two points in your report that I have a problem with. Firstly, the proposal to draw up a list of ports particularly suitable for short sea shipping. I do not consider such a list to be necessary, as it entails a risk of penalising the ports which are not currently entirely suitable, but which are going to be modified in future. Moreover, there is a suggestion that the logistical services offered to users should be combined in a single unit. I am in favour of an information system but, personally, I reject the idea that a thriving major port should have central control of all the services.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should have liked, as a member of the Industry Committee, to have heard someone say clearly that short sea shipping must not be considered as an alternative, but that indeed an intermodal strategy should be found, establishing complementarity between modes of transport. In this context and in this spirit, the Member States should moreover harmonise their regulations so as to prevent distortions, which, particularly in the case of mainland transport, often cause hold-ups. If we wish to achieve a multimodal system, it is important to have a set of means of transport and regulations that are, if not common to all, then at least perfectly harmonised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report show that short sea shipping is an issue on which there is the widest agreement between you, the Member States, and the Commission and the agreement goes further. I know of no one and no organisation which does not wish to see short sea shipping developed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past we were guilty of talking short sea shipping down. We mentioned its potential and by doing so implicitly said that it was not really doing very well. But it is doing well. It was not much publicised but short sea shipping was the only mode of transport which, during the 90s, could more or less keep pace with the development of road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must give credit to the short sea shipping industry. However there is always room for improvement. The shipping industry is the first to acknowledge this. Let me mention a few key issues in Mrs Peijs report. We need a comprehensive approach to make this a genuine door-to-door concept. It must be fully integrated in the transport chain and be offered through one-stop shops.</p>
<p class="contents">Several bottlenecks hamper the development of short sea shipping. The Commission services are currently identifying these bottlenecks and potential solutions, together with the new Member States and industry. One area which has already been identified is the diversity of documents required. To create more uniformity, the Commission intends to present a proposal by the end of the year aiming to harmonise certain ships' arrival and departure documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The efficiency of ports is crucial for short sea shipping, and also by the end of the year the Commission will present a package of measures intended to enhance that efficiency through liberalisation. Further, the old fashioned image of short sea shipping needs to be changed. That was already mentioned in the debate and I appreciate that very much.</p>
<p class="contents">National short sea promotion offices should play an essential role in implementing this policy. Some promotion offices already exist and the Commission encourages establishing further offices so that we can create a European network of promotion. In the debate the question of Community grants was raised, and I would like to answer the question here.</p>
<p class="contents">The main source of Community grants to short sea shipping has in the past been the PACT Programme, that is a Pilot Action for Combined Transport. Last year around 40% of the PACT budget was used to favour combined short sea shipping and that amounts to EUR 2.3 million. It will even be more in the 2000. We will increase the share up to 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">The DG responsible aims to continue this trend, so that short sea shipping will continue to receive its fair share of the PACT budget. In the forthcoming revision of PACT this principle could even be incorporated into the legal text.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Purvis, has asked me to pass an invitation to Commissioner de Palacio. I certainly will do that and Mrs Palacio will enjoy a romantic trip to Scotland. It would be even more romantic if you would invite me to accompany her.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs, thank you for your work. Thank you for ensuring that we all move in the same direction. Let us all do it together, the Commission will certainly do its best.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
