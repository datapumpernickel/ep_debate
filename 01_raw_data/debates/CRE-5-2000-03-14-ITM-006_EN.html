We are talking about harmonisation, the harmonisation of tastes, of habits and, almost, of cultures. In short, chocolate is a dividing factor and the divisions are neither ideological nor even national, whatever some parties might think.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes defending cocoa-producing countries an ideological matter, I ask you? It is an ethical matter. In terms of the social aspect, we are talking about millions of families who make their living from cocoa production. We have made formal commitments to them. So what is the reason for this time limit? Sixty-six months to carry out a study of the impact of this directive, such a time period is enough to cause irreparable damage to the export structures of these countries. The potential impact must be investigated in advance, that is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, if we must have harmonisation, for a consumer that is ever more demanding about the quality of what he eats and who, incidentally, has asked for nothing and has absolutely nothing to gain in this matter, in my view, the absolute minimum would be to limit the quality label or any other label of excellence to 100% cacao chocolate, real chocolate. Any other sort of harmonisation would mean lowering standards and that is not the sort of Europe that the consumer wants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the European Union lays down rules governing the production of chocolate, then these should be geared to protecting the cocoa farmers in the third world, especially in Africa. Rules are also important to protect consumers against genetic modification and against the addition of unexpected substances. Lastly, rules are important to protect expertise and craftsmanship within Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">What is now threatening to happen is at complete odds with this. Should free trade be granted absolute priority? This may fit in rather well with the development currently taking place within the European Union. A social-democratic and christian-democratic project is being developed to put protective measures in place within a highly liberalised economy in which anything goes, and which promotes competition and considers the consumer’s freedom of choice to be sacrosanct. The price to be paid for this, by African farmers in particular, is too high. </p>
<p class="contents">I value the attempts made by Mr Lannoye to keep these negative developments within bounds, but it would be better still to continue to offer full protection against the processing of other products and cocoa butter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst I respect the commitment of the rapporteur to his cause, I suggest to the House that is nonsense. This is not just a matter for big business: it is of great concern to little consumers, millions of them throughout the EU who wish for and deserve the right to choose, without having pejorative labelling applied to the product.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lannoye says that he has gone back to retable some of the original amendments. I suggest to the House that this is not a time to go back – this is a time to move on, to move forward. This is a single market issue; this House should not be standing in the way of the completion of the single market but should be actively promoting it.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could share one brief historical fact with the House concerning my own country: the first mention of solid chocolate being sold in the UK was in 1657 when a Frenchman opened a shop in London. So if it was legal in 1657 for a Frenchman to sell his chocolate in London, can I suggest to the House that, some 350 years later, it should at long last be legal for an Englishman, or indeed any other EU national, to sell his chocolate throughout the EU including the country of the rapporteur.</p>

The present debate has perhaps given me, as a war child, a certain insight into how things were when the peoples of Europe were killing each other for values symbolised by rather more important things than chocolate. After all, this is not a product which is a threat to people’s health. Neither Scandinavian, Belgian nor British chocolate is dangerous. It is not a product which affects the environment to any great degree. The whole issue is therefore somewhat ridiculous. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the developing countries, I want to say that, if Britons, Scandinavians and others are not allowed to eat the chocolate they ate as children, they would certainly eat marshmallows or jelly babies instead on a Saturday evening.

Nor can we say that one kind tastes better and another worse. Rather, we shall leave it to the individual consumer to judge which kind tastes best and is of the highest quality. Consumer choice is the basic principle of the market economy and, as politicians, we should not be instrumental in running a kind of nanny State. </p>
<p class="contents">Malta’s former prime minister, Dom Mintoff, attempted during the 1970s to reduce chocolate imports and to alter the way in which chocolate was consumed by tourists and by his own people. With Chinese help, a chocolate factory was built on the island, but consumers did not like the locally produced chocolate and chocolate consumption fell. If we direct developments in such a way as to create a situation in which there is only the one tradition of chocolate manufacture within the EU, cocoa-producing countries will be in danger of losing out since there would be a great risk of total chocolate consumption within the EU appreciably decreasing. Let us not, therefore, make the same mistake as Dom Mintoff.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that information about the contents of certain forms of chocolate should be provided on the front of the packaging is discriminatory and completely unjustified. It would be more like the kind of warning you find on cigarette packets. </p>
<p class="contents">The chocolate war has been raging within the EU for 25 years. It has made ourselves as politicians and the EU as an institution look faintly ridiculous. In the future EU, too, and within a society characterised by diversity, there must be room for two traditions of chocolate manufacture. We now have the opportunity to bring the 25 year-old European chocolate war to an honourable end for all the parties concerned. We ought therefore to adhere precisely to the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the chocolate which I love so much were to be at risk or if the tradition of Belgian chocolate manufacturers were to be in danger, then I would, of course, be opposed to it. </p>
<p class="contents">I bought some chocolate here in Strasbourg this morning and the French sales assistant explained to me quite clearly what exactly I was buying. The designation on the front of the product states: <span class="italic">Prestige noir intense 72% cacao</span> and in gold lettering, which, in France, is quite something, <span class="italic">chocolat belge</span>. So I know what I bought. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the pending directive will make it even easier for producers of quality chocolate to set themselves clearly apart from the others if they so wish.</p>
<p class="contents">I do concur with the rapporteur on one point. The producers of cocoa beans, namely the small farmers in the poor third-world countries, are vulnerable. We need to keep a close eye on them and this is why I am in favour of a study being carried out by the Commission on the effects of the directive, no more than two years after the introduction of this directive. So let us now deal with this matter once and for all and ensure that everyone can eat the chocolate they fancy and that a real internal market can be established for chocolate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It constitutes a delicate compromise which was difficult to achieve but which is well-balanced. </p>
<p class="contents">Through the common position, the free movement of cocoa and chocolate products was introduced, but with strict conditions governing production and consumer information. It is permitted to add vegetable fat other than cocoa butter to the minimum quantity of cocoa required in accordance with the Directive, but no more than five per cent. Only those substances listed in the annex may be used. They are all of tropical origin and produced in ACP countries. The presence of these substances must be indicated separately but in the same area of the packaging as the product name and list of ingredients. Consumers will then be able to choose and to distinguish these products from those which are manufactured exclusively from cocoa. </p>
<p class="contents">These conditions and restrictions, which are not linked to health issues, are the fulcrum of the common position. The common position also provides answers to the questions and concerns of consumers, of cocoa-producing countries and of countries which produce chocolate, with or without vegetable fats. Any change would seriously upset the balance of the agreement which the Council has agreed upon and would be doomed to fail. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s recommendation on second reading contains two amendments. The first amendment reiterates the Commission’s policy, and this can be approved. The second really does not belong in a separate Directive because releases of genetically modified organisms onto the European market must be handled in a uniform and comprehensive way, which is what happens within the framework of the provisions governing the voluntary spread of genetically modified organisms in the environment and in the regulation concerning new foods and new food ingredients. The second amendment may nonetheless be approved in principle. There must be a more thorough examination of the consequences of these amendments against the background of the World Trade Organisation’s pronouncements and the Montreal protocol. The other amendments, which were rejected by the Commission’s Directorate-General for the Environment, concern questions of special significance to the balance of the common position and cannot therefore be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">The common position involves a real compromise and is a clear advance on the legislation currently applicable. This hails back to the 1970s and is very incomplete, especially when it comes to labelling and consumer information. To summarise, it is only Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which may be approved, and this for the aforesaid reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you will all remember, during the last part-session here in Strasbourg, the European Parliament debated and adopted a resolution in which it condemned and stated its concern at the difficult conditions under which journalists work in Angola. It also condemned the trials they are constantly subjected to and the consequent lack of free speech and absence of a free press.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Members who spoke in this debate was Mário Soares, who also supported the resolution adopted by a majority of this House. Quite unexpectedly, the Angolan government, through one of its ministers and also one of its Members of Parliament, reacted to Mário Soares’ participation in the debate with defamation, slander and insults, accusing Mr Soares, with no evidence whatsoever, of being one of the main beneficiaries of the illegal diamond and ivory trade allegedly being carried out by UNITA, the main opposition to the MPLA in Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">These unacceptable statements by the Angolan Government not only affect Mário Soares. They affect all of us who adopted the resolution in question. Given these circumstances, Mr President, I would like to express my complete solidarity with Mr Soares in the face of the slanderous campaign that has been targeted at him. I also invite the President of the European Parliament to express to the Angolan Government, through the appropriate channels, this Parliament’s most vehement and indignant protest at the insult that was also targeted at this House, and which represents, apart from anything else, an intolerable abuse of the principle of independence that Members enjoy in carrying out their duties.</p>

<p class="contents">During the last part-session, in February, a debate was held on the situation in Angola and a resolution was adopted by this House. In response to this resolution, the Angolan Ambassador in Paris wrote a letter to the European Parliament, and in this letter, a copy of which I have here, he insinuated at a certain point that a fellow Member of this House, Mário Soares, has political, ideological and “other kinds” of links with the war criminal Jonas Savimbi. In addition to this letter, further statements were made, which are false, insulting and which attempt to undermine the dignity and honour of a fellow Member of this House, who has, in the past, been an excellent President of a Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we all have the right to express our opinions in this House and in a democracy. We may agree with something or we may not. What is unacceptable is that a state that maintains relations with the EU should be allowed to respond by attempting to undermine the dignity and honour of a fellow Member of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is, therefore, whether the President of the European Parliament has already responded to the Angolan Government through its Ambassador in Paris? If it has already responded, what was the tenor of its response? If it has not yet responded, it is crucial that this House is clear and unequivocal in repudiating the attitude of the Angolan Government towards our colleague, and therefore towards the European Parliament, an area of freedom and democracy in which we all have the right to express our opinion.</p>

<p class="contents">I would also like to make it quite clear, however, that as regards the European institutions, this is not only a matter of ensuring that the European Parliament issues a protest and a repudiation. It would be useful if the Council, whose President is currently the Portuguese Prime Minister, could respond with equal vehemence to the criticism made of a Portuguese Member of this House, and did not maintain the equivocal stance that it has adopted concerning the offence that the Angolan Government has caused to that Member of this House, as well as to the institutions of the European Union. This House therefore clearly repudiates Angola’s attitude and hopes that the EU Council Presidency will also clearly voice this repudiation and will not remain silent in the face of these accusations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
