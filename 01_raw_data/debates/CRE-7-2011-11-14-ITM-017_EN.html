The issue of professional qualifications is very important and is one of the top priorities of the Single Market Act to boost growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is a great opportunity for Parliament to provide real input and focus for the Commission’s future legislative proposal due to be released on 13 December. First and foremost, I would like to thank my fellow shadows; I am extremely grateful for all the input they have provided throughout the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, I have met with many different professionals, regulators, competent authorities and other stakeholders. They all tell me the same thing: professionals across the EU are waiting for us to deliver on our promise to enhance mobility. They are providing essential services across the EU, helping to drive our economy and enhancing our citizens’ quality of life. They are keen to help deliver for the single market. We need to provide a framework that enables them to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting my report, I took into consideration their views and came up with four areas where improvements in the directive could be made. In the first place, we need to simplify information and procedures for citizens and professionals. Competent authorities, professional bodies and Member States need to provide clear, concise and centralised information to professionals. That is why I have asked the Commission to establish an on-line portal that clearly provides all the necessary information and signpost professionals to the relevant authorities in the host Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a number of the provisions currently used in the directive require immediate updating. Critically, we also need to update the way in which professions are regulated across the EU. I firmly believe that the most effective way to enable the free movement of workers would be to reduce the number of regulated professions in Europe, whilst maintaining the necessary safeguards and caveats for those professions with health and safety implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the protection of public health and safety is a vital aspect of this directive. Continuous professional development is absolutely crucial in maintaining professional standards, especially in the health care sector. On the controversial issue of languages, I have asked that the Commission clarify the provisions in the directive so as to allow competent authorities flexibility in assessing language skills during the recognition process. Most importantly, I have asked the Commission to implement a proactive alert mechanism contained within the internal market information system that will trigger an alert to all Member States when regulatory action has been taken against a professional’s rights to provide services, whilst respecting personal data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a major problem described by many professionals in the public consultation is quite simply a lack of trust in the current system. I therefore asked the Commission to introduce an obligation that competent authorities proactively share information over the IMI system to inject this confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come to the issue of the professional card. It is clear that whilst it may be valuable to some professions, concerns raised in the pilot projects reveal that the concept still needs to be refined. That is why I am very clear in my belief that any card must be voluntary, and that a thorough impact assessment is absolutely crucial to determine whether or not the professional card will be a useful initiative. Sadly, a number of my colleagues did not share my view and instead voted in committee to push the card through without an impact assessment. However, in my report, we have called on the Commission to provide evidence of added value of the card before it is introduced, and I hope that they will do just that.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />There are other areas where I would have preferred a different outcome and which I hope we can improve on with the legislative proposal. Nonetheless, the report as a whole provides an excellent indication to the Commission on Parliament’s position. On a number of issues, we are very clear: we need to make information on recognition easier to understand and access; we need to update those existing provisions that are out of date, and we need Member States to reconsider the justifications for regulating certain professions. We must maintain and build up the protections granted to the public and patients by establishing an alert mechanism. Finally, we must inject confidence into the system, utilising IMI, ensuring proper transposition by Member States, and investigating the potential value of a professional card.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, I would like to thank the Commission, especially Jürgen Tiedje, and, once gain, the shadows and advisers, for working so hard on this dossier. I look forward to working closely with all of you again when the legislative proposal is released later this year; thank you for helping to make my first report such a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, honourable Members, good evening to you all. I would like to thank you for giving me the floor in order to raise an extremely important issue at a time when our discussions are centred on our citizens, the single market, and the human dimension of that single market, which we wish to enhance. Recognition of professional qualifications is of vital interest to our citizens. Twenty-eight per cent of them today envisage working in another country at some point in their career.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 2007 and 2010, the automatic recognition of professional qualifications allowed more than 100 000 Europeans to make that personal goal a reality. We believe this mechanism has even greater potential. Today, it applies to some 6.4 million professionals, of whom 5.7 million are health professionals, 160 000 are veterinary surgeons, and more than 435 000 are architects.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, these sorts of figures clearly show what free movement of professionals could mean for the internal market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want to, and should, facilitate that recognition, making it simpler and faster. The recognition of qualifications is a vehicle for greater trust, and goodness knows we need our citizens and businesses to trust more in the European project right now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to follow these general remarks by saying how happy I am that the own-initiative report you have just presented, Ms McClarkin, shows real convergence with many of the ideas proposed in the Commission Green Paper published last June. This confirms once again the strong cooperation between our two institutions, which I value greatly. I also witnessed the quality and sincerity of our relationship at the public conference organised by the Commission on 7 November in Brussels, at which many of you were present, particularly the Chair, Mr Harbour, as well as Ms Turunen, Ms Vergnaud and Ms Le Grip, who were all keen to speak in the panel discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to thank you, Ms McClarkin, and the Chair, Mr Harbour, and to welcome the work carried out by the other Members of the European Parliament who, as part of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, contributed to the discussion you have presented in a highly constructive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to state that, as far as I am concerned, the report you have just presented provides clarification and makes a very significant contribution right at a time when we are putting the finishing touches to the legislative proposal that will be presented by the Commission on 20 December. Our positions are not always identical but, apart from a few subtle differences, there are no major differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to emphasise four important points. First of all, the professional card. The main aim of modernising the directive is to promote mobility by simplifying the procedures involved in the mutual recognition of qualifications, and by making them more efficient. As I have already said, that is why we are considering creating this European professional card, which should be simple, practical and specific. It is not a traditional smart card, which could prove very expensive and, in any case, difficult to bring out at a reasonable cost. The card we are proposing would be more like an electronic certificate based on an information exchange between the competent authorities. This card would be optional for professionals but compulsory for the competent authorities, and could reduce the time required to process a recognition request from several months to a few weeks. Of course, the Member States of origin would need to be much more involved, and, as was said earlier, the internal market information system (IMI) would have to be used in order to help reduce costs for all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the number of regulated professions. I am aware – and you also mentioned it a moment ago, Ms McClarkin – of the debate on the number of regulated professions, which some consider too high. On this sensitive issue, I would like to put things in context. Of the 800 categories of regulated professions, 43% are health professionals, and 9% work in education or are professionals from the social sector. If I may give my opinion objectively, I do not think it is unreasonable that, given the sensitive nature of these sectors, the professions included within those sectors should be regulated. I therefore believe that we should first look at what exactly is being regulated and why. I have not excluded the idea of initially applying a compulsory, enhanced transparency measure for Member States. It is up to those Member States to endeavour to make a critical analysis of the number and type of regulated professions. The other day, I attended the Competitiveness Council, where one of the ministers around the table, the Portuguese minister, explained that Portugal had taken the decision to eliminate around 15 regulations that were considered unnecessary. However, while we are waiting for Member States to take the steps we have encouraged, we shall propose solutions such as partial access, which could reduce the difficulties experienced by some professionals in terms of mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns preserving automatic recognition. Automatic recognition is a system that currently promotes mobility. It is an <span class="italic">acquis</span> that we want to maintain. I am very pleased that Parliament supports this view. Nevertheless, I shall propose to modernise the system and go even further by extending it to other professions, particularly through common frameworks for training, which could be useful in replacing the previous concept of common platforms. We need to modernise, certainly, but without undermining automatic recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with that in mind, Ms McClarkin, that you just mentioned the issue of language requirements for health professionals, which should be approached with a certain amount of caution. The problem is not the directive itself. I believe this directive establishes an obligation for professionals to have a knowledge of the language of the host country, which is clearly needed if they are to properly exercise their profession. We believe that the problem stems from the implementation of this obligation for health professionals in Member States. I have two comments to make on this point. Firstly, as far as salaried professionals are concerned, I would highlight the role of employers, who should verify their employees’ language skills, and also I would point out that the best solution we have on this matter is severing the links between language skills testing and recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a fourth and final point to make: points of single contact (PSCs). For businesses and self-employed professionals, the Services Directive was a major step forward. I would also like to say that, in my visits to the Member States and my dealings with national governments, I endeavour each week to check for proper transposition and, above all, implementation of the Services Directive, which has more potential than is currently being exploited. The Services Directive represented real progress, with the establishment of PSCs in order to obtain information and complete administrative procedures electronically. Salaried workers and health professionals should benefit from those same advantages. We should therefore establish an online central information point, as you have suggested yourself, based on those PSCs, enabling professionals to carry out the recognition procedure online.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the four points I wanted to mention, and may I sincerely thank you once again, Ms McClarkin, for the quality of your report, which is going to be of great use to me and my services in the coming days, before we put forward the legislative proposal on 20 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first one is the fact that the mutual recognition of professional qualifications promotes the free movement of people and employees, and their application in the labour markets of the EU’s Member States undoubtedly contributes to increasing employment and also to the mobility of the workforce. The legislation applied in this field no doubt needs to be reviewed, focusing, in particular, on simplifying administrative procedures and on the speedier recognition of qualifications, a reduction in the number of regulated professions and, hopefully, the better coordination of professional training. As for the professional card, which we understand rather as a specific database or electronic database, we can see two aspects of this issue. The first one would be a database of persons with a certain level of qualification and who wish to be included in such a database in order to ensure easy recognition of their qualifications in other countries; this database must be voluntary and could be organised on a national level. In contrast to this is a database of persons who, for some reason, have been prohibited from carrying out their profession. Such a database must be mandatory and uniform across the whole Community. Finally, I would like to emphasise that the European Union is not competent to make decisions on the subject of professional qualifications; it can only make proposals to Member States and create an infrastructure for the mutual recognition of qualifications between the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is estimated that there is a need for around a million health care professionals in Europe. This means that we need a quick and efficient system for recognising qualifications, and the professional card could facilitate this process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the health care sector, mobility must be combined with safeguarding and ensuring patient safety. This is the direction taken by the report voted for by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for which I was rapporteur. Mobility and patient protection must be considered two sides of the same coin. Therefore, extension of the rapid reaction mechanism to the health care professions is not only commendable, but also necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has expressed its support for Ms McClarkin’s report; we have made a significant contribution to drawing up the report and, of course, we support its main recommendations for greater professional mobility, and greater simplicity and efficiency in the procedures for recognising professional qualifications while protecting consumer and patient safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the issue of increased professional mobility is being discussed mostly in terms of promoting growth. What is more, the Single Market Forum held in Kraków at the beginning of October was absolutely right on this. It reminded us that Member States should recognise the internal market’s potential to boost growth and job creation, and should act in order to remove all barriers to the completion of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council meeting of 23 October also established as one of its main priorities, in order to achieve – and I quote – smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the implementation of the 12 levers of the Single Market Act, which are 12 proposals put forward by the Commission, one of which is the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to us that by increasing professional mobility, we can expect to unlock the growth potential of the internal market – our internal market – of 500 million citizens, of 500 million consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Professional mobility should therefore enable us not only to guarantee the free movement – if enhanced, modernised and improved – of our compatriots within this market, but also, we hope, to achieve higher growth rates. That is why we in the PPE Group – may I stress the idea of a practical recommendation – have given exceptional support to the establishment of a voluntary professional card. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It relates to one of the fundamental rights of the EU: freedom of movement and of establishment. However, it remains limited because we are still lacking simple, clear rules for the recognition of professional qualifications. Repeated tidying-up of legislation does not hide the anachronism of some mechanisms that date back to a time when cross-border mobility was still anecdotal.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that today, 50% of young Europeans are willing to go and work in another Member State, and the new directive will need to take up that challenge. This is a major project. The lack of basic harmonisation of training, the high number of regulated professions and the complexity of the recognition process create legal uncertainty, so much so that this issue accounts for 16% of the complaints made to the SOLVIT network.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim is to simplify procedures for citizens, guarantee transparent decision making and reduce delays through better cooperation between competent authorities and between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The classification of economic activities should also be reviewed, because professions and related training requirements are constantly evolving. I welcome the fact that the report focuses on the specificities of the health care professions, due to the implications in terms of patient safety, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I clearly support the creation of a voluntary European professional card system. This type of card should, in particular, facilitate the steps involved and improve consumer and patient safety. Beyond that, this card will help to build a European identity and show that the single market is not only about movement of goods and people, but that it can and should be the basis for economic wealth and shared citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate Ms McClarkin on this good report, which, I hope, will be widely adopted tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to put forward five main points from the Group of the Greens that we consider to be particularly important in this report. First of all, we believe that more flexible frameworks and quicker procedures must not result in a reduction in professional skills. Secondly, the health and safety of patients and consumers must be paramount. Thirdly, further automation and harmonisation must be carried out on the basis of the wishes of the industry and professions, based on their voluntary cooperation. Fourthly, we are very much in favour of a professional card, that is to say, a form of e-card scheme which can be continually updated and which is based on the system that is already in operation, namely, the Internal Market Information system (IMI). Fifthly, we believe it is very important to focus on continued professional development and upskilling. That is something to which we in the Group of the Greens attach a great deal of importance, so I would like to thank the rapporteur, and we look forward to working on the legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows that this group in particular is deeply engaged with issues that we want to move forward on the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This report represents more than two years of work by members of my committee. Ms McClarkin has pulled together many of the issues that we have worked on in two public hearings, in an interparliamentary meeting, and indeed in one-to-one meetings with parliamentarians in different countries. It is an indication of how this Parliament should be working.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to get a proposal from the Commissioner – and I welcome him very much here today and thank him for that work – but we want to feed into that, as he said, before he puts that piece of work together. We are talking about issues like smarter and better regulation in this Parliament. This is the way that committees need to be engaged in that. This is a great example. I want to thank all my colleagues for working on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say as far as the single market is concerned, that the single market is not a bloodless bureaucratic creation. It is built on the skills and talent of millions of people, and people have an entitlement under the single market rules to have their qualifications speedily and effectively recognised. We are not delivering that entitlement properly, but hopefully, as of next year, we will be able to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are professions which require continuous training, and it is important that this should be accessible and verifiable at all levels in Europe.

When leaving the economic and financial crisis behind us, we should particularly encourage the mobility of EU citizens so that we will be able to respond more quickly and effectively to the needs of labour markets in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that freedom of movement and the right to take up work in other Member States has long been a core value of the EU, citizens still face many barriers and obstacles resulting from different conditions and national legislative solutions. At present, only 2% of EU citizens work in a Member State other than that of which they are nationals. However, some 20% express a willingness to take up work in another country, which shows that we are dealing with an untapped potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Procedures for the recognition of professional qualifications still form an example of barriers to the freedom to take up work in another EU country. In this situation, a full revision of the current directive is required, but also the proper and rapid implementation of new rules in the Member States. New rules should be based on simplified procedures, good information, reducing the number of regulated professions and the introduction of a more automatic recognition of professional qualifications. Only in this way will we incite citizens to greater mobility and guarantee the fundamental right to take up work freely elsewhere in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of recognition of professional qualifications is only one of the elements of a long-term and comprehensive strategy on mobility, which Europe needs in order to ensure sustainable growth. Eliminating all existing legal and administrative obstacles to the free movement of workers should be a priority for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are still far too many problems and obstacles raised by the Member States, as well as difficulties posed by European law, and it is important that we should tackle this issue.

I am not sure. What I am sure about is that regulation is extremely important and necessary.</p>

Today, Europe is on the brink of stagnation at the very least, if not a recession. Coming through such a period will be extremely difficult. Today, the Union and its institutions suffer from a lack of legitimacy and the faith of its citizens in its future is rapidly draining away. The solution for the current situation is definitely not a further strengthening of the Union and the transfer of further powers to Brussels, but a return to the original concepts of European integration, and a re-launch of the internal market and the Single Market Act. Increasing the mobility of a qualified workforce and reducing the number of regulated professions is an effective solution to the current economic problems of certain Member States. For this reason, I would like to call on Member States not to be swayed by the populist lure of protectionist measures for national labour markets, but, quite the opposite, to remove existing barriers more speedily and, instead of creating national preference measures, to focus on reinforcing their own strengths in a competitive and functioning internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given the increasing numbers of skilled young graduates who find themselves without employment, it is essential that the EU puts in place a system that allows our graduates to move and secure employment across the 27 Member States with ease. Studies show that 50% of young Europeans wish to work abroad but are hindered in doing so by a cumbersome process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the current system of recognising professional qualifications earned in another Member State is time consuming, complex and not employer-friendly. The harmonisation of rules concerning the exchange of information for each individual profession would be a welcome step, along with creating database systems and information-sharing processes that will assist graduates in their mobility across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I wish to draw Parliament’s and the Commission’s attention to the problems that graduates are dealing with in terms of the grey area around professional qualifications. By this, I mean compulsory probationary periods that are not being recognised across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I personally know of a young qualified teacher who has been awarded the academic qualification for teaching but cannot take up work as a teacher as the probationary training undertaken in the UK is not recognised in Ireland. However, her counterparts have no problem qualifying in the UK and completing their probationary training in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">This administrative contradiction is placing many teaching graduates in limbo. Their professional qualifications are recognised, but they still cannot take up employment as they cannot get registered.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of equivalence of standards here is causing real problems for graduates and requires immediate action from the Member States and the Commission in order to stop them being penalised for being mobile and taking up training opportunities in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Graduates should not be left in limbo, and measures need to be implemented without delay to ensure that they have access to a truly internal market and that the Professional Qualifications Directive is broad enough to cover all aspects of qualification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recognition of professional qualifications – either for further education or for finding a job on the labour market beyond the borders of one’s home land – is certainly a priority in this context. We have to enable professionals to look for work, wherever in the Union that work may be.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the implementation of this directive in practice has shown where this situation is more complex and where the problems of recognising qualifications and diplomas persist. And, of course, this has to be changed.</p>

For generations, the UK has welcomed and valued doctors from many countries. However, the directive is not as successful as the Commissioner would like us to believe. Colleagues, please consider the tragic death of one of my constituents, Mr David Gray. He was killed by a doctor. The doctor did not recognise the drug he took from the standard medicine bag and administered a lethal dose.</p>
<p class="contents">A tragedy like this undermines confidence in the very many thousands of excellent doctors from many different countries we have working in our country and across the EU. All doctors need to prove to the national regulator that they have not only academic qualifications but also have language and communications skills, as well as familiarity with local practices, and the EU directive must be amended to allow this.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of recognising professional qualifications is also recognising disqualifications. The ‘alert’ mechanism will help, but we must be able to share concerns as well as judgments. I welcome the report but would have liked to see it go further. Patient safety must come before politicians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we need in this context is to modernise the system for recognising professional qualifications by linking formal education with non-formal practical learning, once skills have been determined, evaluated and recognised within it. This will help people from low-income brackets who, for economic and social reasons, do not have the facility to study or access to the formal education system.</p>

As a corollary, failure to recognise professional qualifications is often a strategic decision, namely a move to keep wages as low as possible, drawing a veil over the applicability of collective wage agreements in order to cover up the principle that the same wage should or must be paid for the same work at the same location.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from the eastern part of Austria. A large number of cross-border commuters from Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic work there, many of them finding that their often excellent qualifications are not recognised. This results in a ‘lose-lose’ situation for all workers, namely, for those who come to Austria with excellent skills, but whose qualifications are not recognised, and, on the other hand, for Austrian workers, who naturally find themselves under corresponding pressure. This means that the principles that the report now pursues – transparency, simplified recognition processes and a voluntary professional card – are a positive development in the final analysis. I hope that the Commissioner will take up these proposals in order to take control of the problems I have described. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be made easier for people to find out which authority is responsible for recognising a particular professional qualification. We need a faster, simpler recognition procedure. We cannot have a situation where an applicant has to wait several months for his professional qualifications to be recognised. It is only right that the candidate’s knowledge of the language in which he or she is to work should be tested. This is particularly important in the health sector and the associated caring professions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same standards for job descriptions will certainly simplify mutual recognition. A voluntary professional card and skills passport can be useful in this regard. They also provide information about the skills learned. This type of documentation can also indicate which skills a candidate still lacks.

Since 2007, some 100 000 decisions have been made on recognition under the directive, making mobility possible for 85 000 professionals.

<p class="contents">It is precisely because we are thinking in terms of the Single Market Act – which is an agenda for renewed growth – and because mobility is one of the tools for the new growth our citizens need, that we are addressing the issue of professional qualifications today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like to thank you, and then speak about the professional card, which many of you have mentioned and which is a tool I very much believe in. Indeed, in the first few days after I was appointed, many of you drew my attention to this option. A voluntary card for professionals, and a compulsory card for the national authorities: if we succeed, this will certainly result in simplification, as Ms Vergnaud called it, in a shorter time frame and, above all, in the right to more efficient and faster processing for professionals thanks to the expertise of the internal market information system (IMI). I would say to Ms Regner and Ms Klass, who mentioned objectivity and transparency, that through this system, we will be able, I believe, to achieve greater efficiency, speed and also transparency and objectivity as regards professionals’ real qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mr Pirillo that it will also mean that health professionals become mobile more quickly, while the right to safety for patients and those who call on health professionals will be protected. Ms Turunen also mentioned this issue of citizens’ right to safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cabrnoch and Mr Aylward mentioned continuous training. Indeed, we are going to suggest that Member States should have to at least provide an update on what they are doing in the area of continuous training.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Obermayr brought up an important point when he talked about the brain drain. I think that, in countries that are having more trouble than others, mobility could be problematic, and that is why, Mr Obermayr, we need to establish a framework for cooperation and a context for this issue of mobility and the recognition of professional qualifications. May I say that I believe we need more Europe rather than less Europe on this matter. That is my conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Batten, to whom I would say that this is not an ideological document, mentioned – as did Ms Ford – an unusual case involving a ban, with which we are all familiar. Without going into detail, I would just like to point out that the directive contains very clear rules on language skills, particularly for doctors, and Member States must therefore be objective and rigorous in using the tools made available by this directive in order to implement measures and verify people’s skills and ability, even if, in this specific case involving a ban, there was no clear link between the problem that arose and the testing of language knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I would like to say to Ms Vergnaud, who said that mobility is not anecdotal, and to Mr Harbour, that, indeed, it is not anecdotal. It is a major issue within the single market, which is our shared space for economic and social coexistence, and I believe that by establishing a solid framework and proper verification, by facilitating the full recognition of qualifications with the tools we have discussed, and by making use of the Internet, we will achieve higher growth levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Ms Gebhardt, Mr Harbour, Ms McClarkin herself, Mr Kožušník and Ms Irigoyen Pérez raised the issue of regulated professions and the number thereof, as well as the problem of potentially reducing those professions. I would like to restate my conviction. The issue is not whether the number of regulated professions is too high or not high enough, but whether or not regulation, in countries with very numerous or very strict regulations for these professions, constitutes a barrier that is disproportionate to the correct functioning of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I plan to bring greater transparency to this debate by asking all Member States to notify all the professions they regulate and to submit to an objective assessment of the reasons why they believe this type of regulation to be necessary and proportionate. After receiving their responses, we will carry out a benchmarking process to compare all the results of this exercise. I believe the Professional Qualifications Directive already guarantees professional mobility between Member States that regulate and those that do not regulate a specific profession. It provides solutions to ensure the equivalence of qualifications, which is a proposal we shall table on the basis of the clarification provided by your report.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Ms McClarkin, by sincerely thanking you and all those who worked with you, and by reiterating the importance of the report you have presented today. It will make a useful contribution to the Commission’s legislative proposal of 20 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also urgently need to establish a proper system in the European Union for the validation of professional skills so that highly skilled workers and trained professionals are not forced to do unskilled work because otherwise, such workers lose their skills, experience and qualifications in the long term. I would like to draw attention to the fact that dialogue and exchanges of information within each individual profession must be enhanced and that cooperation between the competent authorities and national contact points (NCPs) must be improved, at both national and Community level. The European Commission should support networks of competent authorities and professional bodies for the most mobile professions for the purposes of exchanging general information about national processes and education requirements, sharing best practice and investigating possibilities for deeper cooperation, such as common platforms. In turn, the Member States should improve the efficiency of public authorities in providing information both about workers’ rights and about procedures for the recognition of professional qualifications in order to guarantee workers’ rights and stop the exploitation of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An effort must be made to simplify procedures, in particular, as regards the general system of recognition. I also consider it appropriate to evaluate the implementation and relevance of compensation measures and to adopt optional guidelines for a more uniform approach to the implementation of such measures. Temporary mobility must be supported by clarifying the concept and abolishing the system of prior declaration in cases where service providers accompany a consumer to another Member State without having any contact with local consumers. We could also explore the possibility of coordinating our education systems with a view to achieving a higher degree of harmonisation in the future and being able to extend the system of automatic recognition to other professions as well. Last but not least, voluntary professional cards may be an effective instrument for speeding up the recognition of qualifications but should be introduced only where they add real value to the current system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the proposal on the creation of networks of competent authorities and professional bodies for the most mobile professions and on the continuous exchange of information on educational programmes in order to enhance the credibility of diplomas between Member States, but also to improve the language skills of young people wishing to work in another Member State. Moreover, the introduction of the professional card enabling the holder’s professional training to be recognised at European level will also reduce bureaucratic obstacles and enable Europeans to enjoy greater mobility on the labour market. I also hope that cross-border mobility will be improved as a means of stimulating economic growth and competitiveness within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Freedom of movement is one of the essential rights of membership of the Union, and changing demographics will make the mobility across the European Union increasingly important. At present, only a few professions are regulated at Community level, while the rest are subject to costly and lengthy equivalence procedures, ranging from testing to the requirement of further studies. Bearing in mind that educational reforms are facilitating the process of recognising qualifications at European level through the European Qualifications Framework and the Bologna process, I believe that the list of professions regulated at EU level should be extended. The procedures for recognising diplomas and professional qualifications should also be simplified and accelerated, and this process should be made more transparent. In this context, we should also deal with the problem of the recognition of qualifications of third-country nationals, who should not take priority over citizens of the Member States. I also believe that states should accept all categories of workers on the labour market and not just those who are highly qualified, which leads to the phenomenon of the so-called brain drain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, above all, an economic necessity which should be implemented as soon as possible given that, by the end of 2020, we will need up to 16 million highly qualified professionals. In order for the mobility of these workers to lead to genuine economic recovery, we must make it easier for them to take up work and set up business in the country of their choice where there is indeed a need for their knowledge and skills. To this end, national laws that create unnecessary barriers and difficulties must be revised. It is my conviction that harmonisation of rules in the field of vocational training at European level could be a good solution, although I realise that this would be complicated. Also not without significance is easy access to relevant information for those interested. I therefore urge the European Commission to consolidate sources of information already available so that people wishing to take up an activity in a country other than their country of origin have access in their own language to the necessary documents and information on the appropriate branch organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Member States have not yet implemented the directive and there are still far too many problems with recognition. This is also evident in the document from the Commission on which this own-initiative report is based. I welcome this report whole heartedly because it paves the way for the position the European Parliament is to adopt in relation to the promised revised directive at the beginning of next year. From an employment policy perspective, I would once again emphasise that we need to put an end quickly to the sometimes unfair practices found in the Member States. We cannot have a situation where, in many cases, qualifications are not recognised in order to keep wage costs low. This is clearly a problem of misalignment and is causing difficulties for immigrant job-seekers. This not only constitutes an infringement of the principle of equality, but also significantly restricts mobility within the workforce. The European Parliament needs to take a clear line on this in the forthcoming revision of the directive. I look forward to continued excellent cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
