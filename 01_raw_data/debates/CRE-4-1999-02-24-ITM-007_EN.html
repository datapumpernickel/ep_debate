<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Grosch </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it certainly was a most interesting enterprise to examine the social legislation on transport on behalf of the House, for the different rates of development of liberalisation, which is far advanced in air, sea and road transport but lagging behind in rail and inland waterway transport, also affect the development of social legislation. These nuances had to be taken into account in the report. The social aspects on which the report focussed naturally concern working time, safety and health, qualifications and training, mobility in general and not least employment. As an important economic branch in freight and passenger transport, the transport sector is clearly situated in a field of tension between the demands of competition on the one hand and safety and working conditions on the other. In road and rail transport, it forms part of the public service and is also the basis for the mobility we want for all citizens; with 6 million employed and 3 million self‐employed workers, it also represents an important branch of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons we believe we must look at the social provisions in the field of transport separately, for in areas where liberalisation has occurred without the necessary minimum social rules, competition has had an adverse effect on working conditions and the safety of workers and therefore also of the public. This unregulated competition not only has destructive social effects but also has questionable economic effects. So the kind of realistic and pragmatic harmonisation proposed in this report does not conflict with sensible liberalisation measures – quite the contrary. It will provide the stable foundation this economy needs for sustainable growth. I regard that as the basis of this report, namely complementarity between liberalisation and social harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course – and this is the first aspect on which the report focussed – dialogue with the social partners is vital in the preparation of all the measures to be taken. In this context it must be ensured that they are fully represented; but even if the negotiations do not produce any results, the Commission will have to take legislative action and must not use the inconclusive negotiations as a reason for delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives on working time must now cover every sector of transport. Road transport is a good example because it shows, on the one hand, that the Commission needs to take initiatives but on the other that this is not just a matter of driving time and rest periods. In addition, the concepts of mobile and non‐mobile workers and the various activities involved in the job need new, common definitions in all areas, especially road transport. The flexibility proposed in this report must relate to the various aspects of transport, including working time, but must never call in question the principles of the health and safety of the employees and therefore also of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty thousand transport‐related deaths – there is a report that speaks volumes about road safety. Strikes that paralyse whole countries in a matter of hours, ferry disasters – these were signs of the need for action here. We believe we should not wait for accidents or strikes to create new pressure for taking initiatives in areas where they are still needed. But good rules are not enough in themselves. They will only be effective and even revive the market if uniform checks are carried out and inappropriate behaviour carries uniform penalties in all European Union states. No country may fall short of the minimum controls and Parliament must not be made to wait another four years for the reports evaluating these controls. In this context, modern technology that can improve safety must be used to full advantage and in our view there are no economic interests, such as producers' interests, that allow or justify any failure to draw on technological progress. I need only cite the example of the tachograph. Compared to the technology available now, I would describe the tachograph that is still in use today as well‐nigh medieval.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also places great emphasis on access to employment. Qualifications and their mutual recognition are one of the cornerstones of transport policy, as is working time. They guarantee a quality service and safe working conditions. In air transport, for example, the Council seems reluctant to clear this hurdle, although the aircraft cabin crew perform important safety tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking account of social aspects in the transport system also implies ensuring the mobility of the public in its various forms, which includes the needs of persons with reduced mobility. This concerns the public service and, of course, calls for a very general discussion. Let me conclude by commenting on the employment aspect of transport policy. Every year our Member States spend more than EUR 180 billion on employment, which is why our committee believes that every proposed measure must always be examined as to its employment impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that if we want to create a transport area in the European Community, in which working conditions are no longer detrimental to the health, safety and quality of life of its citizens, we must consent to a minimum of social harmonisation, for there are aspects we need to regulate that the market alone will never be able to regulate. The Treaty of Amsterdam may offer us limited means of doing this. So it is in our hands. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McMahon </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs</span> . – Madam President, Mr Grosch's report introduces wide‐ranging issues covering all the social aspects of transport. The fact that his report was carried virtually unanimously in the Committee on Transport and Tourism shows that there is a great deal of support within Parliament for provision in the social area of transport. Indeed, Mr Grosch's report will be complemented by the forthcoming report from Mr Chanterie, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment dealing with the extension of the general working time directive and my own report on lorry drivers' hours.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that there is a direct link between the proper regulation of working time, the health and safety of employees and, of course, most important of all, passenger safety, irrespective of the mode of transport used. The Commission must be congratulated on assisting the social partners in the railway industry in achieving an agreement on 30 September last year. We rightly believe that a similar agreement should be found in the other transport sectors. Unfortunately, this has not happened and that is why I am producing a report on lorry drivers' hours because the Commission was forced to resort to the legislative route.</p>
<p class="contents">The other area which gives us some cause for concern is the slow progress being made in the harmonisation of flight times and rest periods for air crews. We are particularly perturbed about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment supports the report. We believe several difficulties have arisen with the transport industry as a result of liberalisation. I would mention in particular postal services. In many Member States liberalisation of the postal services has resulted in considerable problems in this sector. As a consequence, postmen throughout the Union are being put on part‐time contracts, in many instances without adequate pension cover. I believe that the concept of universal service should be the norm and it should be applied in the postal services operating throughout the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schlechter </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr Grosch is trying with this report to rekindle a discussion which has been going on for fifteen years or so, aimed at improving Regulations Nos 3820/85 and 3821/85. In the meantime, the Social Affairs Council has adopted a common position on the proposal for a working‐time directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is outrageous to regulate all activities in the private and public sectors and yet to leave unregulated a sector such as road transport which employs over seven million people. In my opinion, in order to put a stop to all the abuses which have occurred in the past and will continue to occur in the future, we must consider annualising working time in the transport sector. We must also decide that any hours worked over and above the standard 48 hours must be classified and paid as overtime, including social security contributions and taxes. I believe this is the only way of persuading employers to stop requiring workers to do unpaid overtime, and it would have the major benefit of allowing professional drivers to take advantage of the right to retire at 55 because of the number of hours they have worked annually and the contributions they have paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I realise that Commissioner Kinnock recently proposed to allow the working time of a professional driver to include all work, in other words all the time when he is at his employer"s disposal. This is a long‐standing trade union demand. In addition, in a fairly specific sector like the transport sector we could go along with Mr Kinnock"s proposals to extend the 48‐hour week to 60 hours if the average of 48 hours per week is not exceeded over four months.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this complex concept will certainly pose problems in practice, and I believe that not enough thought has gone into it. Although calculating 48 hours over four months may not pose any problems for a large company, it could be difficult for small and medium‐sized firms. The supervisory authorities in the Member States would also find this difficult. The new tachograph will clearly help, but until then this idea will only cause problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the supervisory authorities responsible for implementing the regulations must be required to set up a system of checks and sanctions which is both effective and acts as a deterrent. Mr Grosch"s report should lead to the House exerting the necessary pressure on the Commission and the Council of Ministers in order to ensure that the intolerable situation in the transport sector ceases once and for all. In this respect I must thank the rapporteur.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mendes Bota </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, the liberalisation of transport markets, a process started in 1993 as part of the implementation of the internal market, has resulted in greater dynamism and diversification of supply and has in general led to lower prices for consumers. However, the downside of these benefits has been the heavy social and professional cost paid by workers in the transport sector. The general public is normally only aware of such problems when heavy goods vehicle drivers periodically paralyse the whole of Europe with long‐running strikes which inflict serious damage on the economy as a whole and capture the media limelight. The truth is that the climate of exaggerated competition in the transport sector – between companies, between the Member States themselves and between the European Union and the Central and Eastern European countries – has led to instability on the job market, lower wages, less consistent social security provisions and dumping in terms of prices, taxation and the vehicles used.</p>
<p class="contents">The extent of liberalisation in the various transport sectors – road, air, rail, shipping and postal services – still ranges from total liberalisation to a monopoly of the few. This range is also reflected in the working conditions and social protection enjoyed by workers. But there should be a guaranteed minimum level. That is why the Council and the Commission need to intervene to provide for harmonisation of social legislation in the transport sector, as improved safety, greater job security and improved health protection for the workforce also implies higher productivity for companies and enhanced safety for passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are two particular points that cannot go unmentioned. The first relates to road transport and is the issue of working time. This includes not only driving time and time spent loading and unloading the vehicle, but also all the other time during which the worker is at his employer's disposal. This needs to be approached cautiously and impartially, because if companies are faced with an unreasonable definition of working time, they are in danger of becoming non‐viable and possibly going bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, although we support the Commission's firm approach in not extending the scandalous fiscal privilege of duty‐free sales, we also exhort the Commission to adopt specific support measures for the sea transport sector, in view of the serious consequences that this change will have on existing jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we would like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his excellent report.</p>

<p class="contents">I have said right from the start that working time has to be the decisive factor in the transport sector, inclusive of other activities over and above merely sitting behind the wheel or otherwise travelling in a vehicle, ship or whatever. On the other hand, however, there has to be the necessary flexibility in implementing the rules, so that hauliers are not forced to be on the road or travelling for longer than is strictly necessary. If you work longer hours in one week and can be compensated with shorter hours another week, that means that you have to be able to work longer hours in order to complete or conclude a journey.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Grosch is mistaken on one point. We have already introduced rules for the digital tachograph. All we are waiting for now is the latest technical data and then these can be made generally applicable, but the rules are there, and the Commission has been waiting to put forward this proposal so that both things can be dealt with together.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be careful not to get it wrong. The frequent reports of driving and rest periods being exceeded – and grossly exceeded, according to the press – are prompted mainly by the fact that rest periods which are too short are counted as not having been taken at all. This gives rise to idiotic figures of 48 hours" consecutive driving time, which does not happen and is impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one or two more comments to make. Firstly, there must be no discrimination between countries. Secondly, the safety risks of road passenger transport must not be exaggerated. It is the safest mode of transport that we know, with the lowest percentage of accidents per kilometre travelled. And lastly, in maritime transport it is essential, in order to maintain proper levels of infrastructure and training, that we should indeed have very strict rules on this for European crews too, but especially shorter sailing times overall, not working hours, not work and rest periods, but simply a reduction in the length of time that ships are under way.</p>

Social harmonisation in the transport sector is essential and must be keenly pursued. It is essential first for the sake of economic efficiency, which means addressing the glaring inequality between modes of transports, particularly rail and sea transport compared with road transport. Secondly, it is essential in order to improve working and living conditions for employees and to encourage employment. Finally, it is very important for safety, particularly in road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The improvements suggested by our group and accepted by the committee confirm certain important ideas. These include the need to reduce working time without cutting wages, the development of social dialogue and the principle of social non‐regression, so that progress for some does not lead to a backward step for others.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles, together with the demand made in Mr Grosch"s report for a clear definition of working time in the road transport sector, which should include all the time when a worker is at his employer"s disposal, and the confirmation of the role to be played by the public services, should help to promote a progressive approach to the construction of Europe with technical progress and know‐how being used to ensure the advance of civilisation. This involves using everyone"s skills but without opposing existing diversity, which would bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would stress that we must be very careful to ensure that the proposals in the Grosch report are more than just good intentions. They must be incorporated into all the specific decisions which Parliament is called upon to make, particularly in sectors excluded from the working time directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The view which the people of Europe have of the European Union is dependent on the assertion and effective implementation of the principles of social justice. There is a major deficit in this area which must be remedied without delay. Popular sympathy, support and participation are required in order to breathe life into the objective of social harmonisation at the highest level so that the Europe that people want can be constructed.</p>

This particularly concerns transport by air and road. In the field of bus and coach transport, which is a welcome form of transport for environmental reasons, we need Europe‐wide rules to guarantee that overtired drivers do not put passengers and others involved at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to address recitals D and G, in which the rapporteur says that social harmonisation should eliminate competition which is damaging to health, quality of life and mobility and that working time is an important factor in protecting transport safety. Any move to eliminate competition is dangerous on principle. But I believe that in this case, and especially since it is a question of people's safety, it is justified.</p>

I also think that we can agree on certain solutions, but when it comes to decisions in the Council, that is when things slow down. Should good conditions give way to inferior ones? That is what is at stake when harmonisation is under discussion. How do we harmonise? The report shows the extent of the problem, or shows how many opinions there are on this matter. Transport is a cross‐border process and is therefore a suitable area for drawing up common rules. There must be common traffic rules and there must be common provisions on the environment and working time, as the rapporteur also pointed out. On the other hand, we have very large national transport industries. But national rules and traditions are so divergent that social provisions often determine the ability to compete, another point that has been raised here this evening. We have the employees on one side and the transport customers on the other. Safety and working time go together, and that must not be at the expense of competitiveness. In my view, there should be European rules where they are needed, but to a certain extent we need to take account of national agreements and traditions. As soon as we bring social conditions, taxes and duties into the harmonisation context, things go badly wrong. I think that we have an excellent document here, but if we are to achieve a reasonable result, we must see what the possibilities are in the Council of Ministers, and we must see at what level we need to harmonise. I repeat my question: must good conditions give way to inferior ones? That is what we should be discussing.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stenmarck </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, let me begin by thanking Mr Grosch for the effort he has put into preparing this report. There is much that is constructive in the report, on which we now have to take a position, for example where the rapporteur states that the aim of harmonising social legislation is not to control market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of those who has doubts about carrying harmonisation of social legislation in the different countries to extremes. As I see it, social legislation is mainly the responsibility of the individual states. I think this is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, which we refer to in many other contexts, and so to a large extent this would be the appropriate way to go. I would also question whether it is actually possible to proceed in any other way. There are already huge differences in the conditions that exist in the Member States, and they will increase dramatically with each enlargement of the Union to include the countries of Eastern Europe. However, that is not to say that certain areas of social policy would not benefit from having common rules. For instance, there is a need for greater traffic safety, and no one would dispute that having common rules would improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, however, the rapporteur oversteps the mark when he says that a reduction in working time without cuts in wages is one of the major objectives in the transport industry. I do not believe that an across‐the‐board reduction in working time is the answer where traffic safety is concerned. Instead, the hours that people work at a stretch should be reduced and regular rest periods introduced. Clearly, there is good reason to find a common solution at European level.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Madam President, I would like to join with others who have spoken in the debate in congratulating Mr Grosch on his report which is generally complimentary towards the Commission. Naturally therefore, I reciprocate by thanking him and his colleagues on the work they have undertaken introducing this report on social harmonisation in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a helpful reminder that, whilst liberalisation to strengthen transport performance and systems must be pursued, it is essential to ensure that it is undertaken in a way that pays proper regard to the reasonable need of employees and to the security and service of the general public. That is a point Mr Grosch has made himself and it has been echoed throughout the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">On the major issue of working time, it is clear that there is hardly any divergence of view between Parliament and the Commission. I have to advise the House, however, that, as most honourable Members will know, the Commission has absolutely no power to make proposals relating to the desire that reductions in working time can take place without loss of wages, a point made by Mrs Moreau and by others in the course of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community directive on working time – and therefore the current proposals – are based, as the House will know, on the protection of the health and safety of workers. Whilst it is obvious that proper application of that principle could bring about reductions in working hours in some cases, management of the practical consequences of changes in the law must be left to negotiations between employers and employees, preferably through normal social dialogue. Management of that kind obviously cannot – and, indeed, should not – be done by the Commission or by the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns have been expressed about the levels of checks on driving and rest periods and also about the levels of fines and penalties imposed for contraventions. In response, I would say to the House that I agree that controls must be effective. Otherwise, they are meaningless. As Mr Grosch's report recommends, the Commission will consequently propose an increase in the minimum number of checks that have to be carried out. The Commission has also been aware of the concerns relating to fines and penalties for some time and we are currently therefore preparing a report on the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement measures. That report will address all aspects of these questions. Naturally I will acquaint the House with our findings when we have completed that work.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us suggests that there is a need to evaluate measures in the transport sector in terms of their effect on jobs, working conditions and mobility in general. I hope that everyone in the House will accept that neither I nor my colleagues in the transport sector would neglect such issues when preparing proposals. I have to say, however, that I do not think there is any significant added value to be gained from drafting a general report that considers these issues. The House will be aware that all the proposals we present take account of such issues by providing for flexibility or for derogations or for transition periods. I hope the House will recognise that this is a practical and transparent way of doing things and has the essential effect of being a continually applied principle of policy rather than a periodic report which merely offers comments.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, however, a relatively minor point in the overall context of this report and it should not detract in any way from the substance of the work done by Mr Grosch and his colleagues which I am very glad to be able to commend to the House.</p>
