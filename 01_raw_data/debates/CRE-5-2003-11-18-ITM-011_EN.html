<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gutiérrez-Cortines (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following many legislative initiatives, recommendations and studies, the European Commission has promoted a thematic strategy for soil protection. The first point of reference – which I believe to be fundamental – is that the soil is a limited source of wealth, the basis of agriculture and production, of food and support for the landscape. However, perhaps because the horizon always seems infinite, society finds it difficult to understand and accept that it is a limited resource and we therefore have to protect it like any other resource.</p>
<p class="contents">This document not only deals with the protection of the soil, but also the conservation of the earth and the landscape, it is intended to guarantee the safety and health of citizens and prevent all types of risk. I therefore congratulate the Commission on its work. It is a well-produced document, the departure point is coherent and it represents many years of work and I believe that work is continuing in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the text does not have regulatory status – and I would like to stress this – it is a background document which will lead to many actions, directives and recommendations and lays out the key issues which affect the future of the conservation of soils and the landscape. It is what we might call the Commission’s invisible lever which it sometimes uses to create thinking and attitudes in relation to problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As a thematic strategy it intends to implement a scientific policy and carry out much more firm, consistent and coherent work than has been done until now. It intends to detect the cause-effect relationship, the impacts. We also take this approach, we recommend a recognition of the different nature of each soil, of its distinct typology, of the diversity of soils and the application of measures, solutions and methods suited to the site and the characteristics of the location.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have said many times, sustainable development requires a made-to-measure approach and all scientific work has to be appropriate for the reality. This means that we are entering a complex area and that the Commission accepts the difficult challenge of implementing a policy on soils which recognises the diversity of each place, each region and each climate.</p>
<p class="contents">What is Parliament contributing? Parliament insists on the need for referenced and official catalogues and it provides the Commission with several mandates so that, as soon as possible, it may provide a model for catalogues which can be produced in all regions and all countries, which is accessible, geodifferentiated, and always in computerised and compatible form. These catalogues must include a biography of soils, typologies, structures and other variables as well as the uses, possible risks and historic, landscape or cultural values, highlighting the risks of any nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission to develop the draft INSPIRE Directive for the establishment of an infrastructure for a European area of information, which is essential as an instrument for developing these areas and which, at the time, was approved by three Directorate-Generals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would recommend much more precise research in certain fields. We insist on the need to exchange information and research on the use of agriculture. There are many forms of agriculture, and most of them are beneficial to the soil, to its conservation, to prevent erosion, to the maintenance of organic material. I believe the time has come to put an end, scientifically, to the common belief that agriculture is bad for the soil. There are many good forms of agriculture and we must identify them and support them, especially if we want to introduce this issue into the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">Research programmes are recommended which offer solutions and not just diagnoses and classifications, as has been the case until now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on two issues, which are innovative: the commitment to studying the desertification and the relationship with the variables which cause it, such as climate change. I believe that Parliament must continue to insist on relating water to desertification, the problems of the aquifers, the need to provide new resources, the need to look after these climatic spaces and the advance of the desert.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to sealing relating to territorial plans, I would say that although soil sealing and the advance of urbanisation – which in many cases is excessive and uncontrolled – and the loss of soil we are experiencing – which is sometimes dramatic in certain places – is a subsidiary issue, the Commission must, in this case, show new leadership, use these invisible levers which it exercises in certain fields, presenting proposals for good practices. It must insist that there can be no possible conservation of soil unless we include it in land management.</p>
<p class="contents">All good plans and all management plans must include a catalogue of soils and an assessment of them, because that is the only way to prevent floods, to prevent building in storm drains and in Habitat or Natura areas. And in this regard we will support the Commission. It is necessary to implement a soil policy which can really deal with the issue of regional support and support from the States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this, the consultation process on the first phase of the soil thematic strategy will be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes Parliament's broad support for the general approach, main objectives and deliverables presented in the communication. This includes the development of a communication on major soil degradation issues such as erosion, contamination and organic matter, as well as a proposal for a soil monitoring directive. The European Parliament recognises the Community dimension for many of the soil degradation processes Europe is faced with. Parliament underlines that soil degradation processes are progressive and often go unnoticed, sometimes for many decades. This distinguishes soil from other environmental components and goes some way towards explaining why air and water policies were developed earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view that any approach to soil protection must take account of the considerable diversity of regional and local conditions that exist across Europe. The European strategy for soil protection does not mean a standardised, one-size-fits-all approach. The Commission fully agrees that it is vital to apply an integrated approach to soil, based on sustainable development. The multifunctional and cross-sectoral approach to soil is of primary importance. The economic and social implications of soil degradation are therefore an integral part of the soil thematic strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The numerous detailed comments, requests and additional proposals contained in Parliament's resolution will be fully taken into account in the future development of the soil thematic strategy. In this context the Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the knowledge-based approach. The Commission will examine the detailed proposals for a soil catalogue, soil mapping and zoning, which should be geared to solving specific soil degradation problems. We also recognise that it is necessary to gain greater understanding of soil biodiversity, the nutrient and water cycles and the issues related to the use of compost.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the important role attributed to agriculture and forestry in revitalising soil – in particular, the call to make cross-compliance compulsory for all payments under the common agricultural policy; the integration of specific measures for soil and water protection into the CAP; the localised diagnosis of the impacts of CAP reform on soil health; and the definition of patterns of agriculture and forestry, in line with soil characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes Parliament's request to bring land use into line with soil characteristics, to integrate soil protection objectives into spatial planning strategies, to prevent the indiscriminate sealing of land and to prevent the bisection of ecosystems, waterflows and landscapes by road and urban infrastructures. The Commission recognises the need to develop more leadership in Europe in the area of spatial planning.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully subscribes to the role attributed to soil protection in the context of major processes such as biodiversity decline, climate change, desertification, coastal erosion and forest fires. The Commission recognises, in particular, the need for additional action to combat desertification in Europe and will consider Parliament's urgent call for an immediate communication and Community action programme on desertification.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to underline that I consider Parliament's resolution as an important input to our work. We can now further direct our work on the development of the next stage on the soil strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We live on it and we live off it, we travel over it, we wonder at its beauty: reason enough to treat the soil with care.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to discuss a number of aspects of that care. Firstly, it is good to establish that the soil has a less international nature than air or water, which are always moving. Although the Member States have similar problems with their soil to a certain extent, the cause varies. With this in mind, there is reason to fear that a centralised approach will not have the desired result for all the Member States. A European approach must therefore emphasise the exchange of information, knowledge and best practices. It is not clear to me from the present text of the communication whether the Commission has actually even chosen this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines rightly points out the adverse consequences of transport for the soil. Soil compaction and sealing are major adverse effects that infrastructure has on the soil, with consequences for the viability and condition of that soil. Those effects must therefore be minimised and the strain on the soil thus reduced. The promotion of modes of transport that have less or no impact on the soil, such as inland water and coastal water transport, presents an opportunity for doing this, as does the use of less harmful materials in the construction of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Community should also assert its influence directly in the construction of infrastructure by incorporating the interests of the soil into projects in which the Community is investing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are satisfied with the present text as regards the specific transport aspects. Unfortunately, a lack of clarity remains regarding the level of the general protection of the soil and the form this should take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has already been pointed out that this is a very important issue: soil is a vital component for our existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding coastal erosion, I was rapporteur in this Parliament some time ago on coastal zone management. The issue of land use was outside the scope of that report. However, in relation to coastal erosion, a number of elements need to be taken into account, particularly in relation to developments that take place along our coasts. Some coastal erosion is related to nature and is thus outside our control, but quite a lot of coastal erosion is a result of irresponsible planning and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Inland erosion and desertification again come down to the use of our land. The issue of over-grazing in Ireland has caused a major problem in relation to soil erosion in the west of Ireland and also in some other places. Forestry is an issue which has caused major problems in relation to soil erosion throughout the European Union, particularly in the southern part of Europe. These are things that can easily be solved by looking at the way we use land.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to farming, we need to look at the long-term consequences of the kinds of chemicals – such as pesticides and herbicides – used in the soil. As the last speaker said, soil is vital not just in terms of beauty and aesthetic value, but also in terms of our survival, the survival of farming communities, and even the survival of those that to a certain extent have contributed to the major problem in relation to soil.</p>

Indeed, several European policies as well as several directives, such as the IV water directive or the sixth environmental programme, deal with soil protection. A similar issue appears in the Forest-Focus programme. A whole range of projects and directives on environmental responsibility also address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point, furthermore, of defining soil at European level, of drawing up a scientific soil catalogue by 2007 with harmonisation of scientific data on soil, other than to note their diversity, which is already known? What is, moreover, the point of making a diagnosis on the impact of CAP reform when it has been adopted?</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, a simple recommendation would suffice and would avoid once again penalising the farmers that are already severely affected by CAP reform. Let us simplify and rationalise the current texts, and let us finally align European subsidies with the objective that we have followed, by encouraging techniques that are favourable to soil protection and to preserving the wild fauna, such as non-labour and direct sowing techniques. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
