<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, unlike many others who will be speaking this afternoon, I do not have many constituents who suffered horrendously from flooding in the UK. Luckily, London escaped with small-scale floods, partly from rivers we had forgotten still existed because we run them through culverts.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, however, contributed to the causes of these floods of which those in Western Europe are only the latest result of a series of extreme and fluctuating weather conditions. This, of course, will be of small consolation to those living with filthy water running through their houses and who might be facing enormous financial loss.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we need to do all that we can to assist them, but we would help most by changing the situation that has caused their misery and that of countless others throughout the world. Locally, we can stop covering flood plain and water meadows with concrete. We can change our pattern of agricultural production and we can use strategic environmental impact assessment to enable us to work with nature rather than assuming we can conquer it.</p>
<p class="contents">In global terms, we know our use of fossil fuel is profligate and we have not taken sufficient steps to reduce the climate-change gases we produce. We have an opportunity to make progress at The Hague in the discussions there this week and next. We have to implement the agreements we have already reached, but we also have to do as the Treaty states and integrate the environmental perspective into all areas of Union policy and practice, and Member States must be prepared to do this as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to move away from running our economies as if cheap fossil fuel is a good thing. We have to pay the full price for these fuels and we have to shift to a low-carbon economy. For once, I can agree with the words of the British Prime Minister on this and I now await his actions with eagerness.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a wonderful opportunity to really take a lead in this change to an ecologically sustainable society where we will not have to deal with floods partly caused by our own inability to face up to the consequences of our own actions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There was a destruction of homes, of energy, communication and transport networks. In my own region, the Southwest of England, we had all of these consequences. The main railway line between Cheltenham and Swindon remains closed. It will be closed for a month because of the damage caused by the floods. We came within an inch or so of the town of Tewkesbury being cut off. Two major roads were cut for a number of days: the A38 north of Gloucester and the A417 west of Gloucester. It is the worst flooding in the United Kingdom since 1947. In Devon, the River Taw had the highest level since records began. In Somerset, we had tidal flooding across the coastline. In Dorchester, the River Frome was so high that a major-incident plan was invoked to deal with the possible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We still remain on stand-by at the moment. Tens of millions of pounds' worth of damage has been done and I agree with Mrs Lambert that we must take action to deal with our contribution towards the cause of the flooding in terms of our planning regulations, in terms of reforestation, in terms of all of the actions we have taken to make flooding that much more dangerous than in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We also require the EU to give help and assistance, not just in the southwest but across all of the areas that have been affected. The resolution calls on the Commission and the Member States to waste no time in expressing their support in practical ways by marshalling workers and equipment under the five-year plan establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection which was adopted on 9 December 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Commission to make use of all existing funding: ERDF, EAGGF, Guarantee Section, which have already been assigned for use in dealing with disasters of this nature to provide financial aid to SMEs, to farmers, to households, the elderly and others affected, particularly those living in exposed areas who have limited protection as recompense and as assistance towards a speedy recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I speak of the extraordinary series of floods across Europe. I am very well aware, from my work on the Committee on Development and Cooperation, of the recent floods in Mozambique, the Indian sub-continent, Bangladesh, the Mekong Delta and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the list of countries and regions in the resolution, you can see quite how serious this matter has become. There has been loss of life in more than one EU Member State. There has been enormous damage, running into billions of pounds, to small and medium-sized businesses, householders, farmers, the elderly, individuals and particularly the poorest and weakest in our society. It is obvious to me that something is going very seriously wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Today there is a gathering in The Hague of the representatives of COP6. They are meeting to discuss progress on climate change. Last Monday Jan Pronk, Holland's environment minister, stated that the effect of climate change is irreversible for ecosystems, agriculture, water supply and health. The less we do and the longer we wait to tackle the root of the problem, the more serious the effects and the greater the strain on the resilience of peoples, plants and animals. This is undoubtedly true. The issues that are being discussed are for the medium and long-term.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this resolution tabled right across Parliament, including by my colleagues from England, deals with a very real and short-term problem faced by thousands and thousands of people in Britain and across Europe. In Britain alone the estimated cost of the damage is about GBP 4 billion, only half of which is covered by insurance. Across Europe this bill will rise and rise like the water level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must make all speed to use its energies and funds to ensure that those affected in the hardest hit areas are helped immediately, through such instruments as the ERDF and the EAGGF Guarantee Section. We must in particular help our farmers, small businesses, the elderly and the householders who have been inundated time and time again. There is a question as to whether some of these people who have been flooded will be able to be reinsured and whether the insurance companies will take this on again.</p>
<p class="contents">There must also be a realisation that the rush to build housing all over the green belt and in rural areas is dangerous folly. There was often a good reason why our forefathers did not build on these areas because they flood. Yet today there are governments, like the present Labour government, which are steamrolling informed local opinion into building on precisely these areas. I do not know exactly the situation across Europe but in the south-east of England this is a real and present danger. We must fight this headlong rush. We must take stock and take serious action to cut carbon dioxide emissions. We must prepare effectively and in a coordinated way in order to protect ourselves. We must do all in our power to help those already suffering from the terrible effects of the weather, both here in Europe and across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I further ask, in addition to the resolution that we have tabled, that we here in Parliament hold a public hearing on climate change in the near future and I now ask the Committee of Presidents to consider this. I ask you all to support our resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my own constituency the towns of Clonmel, Fermoy and Mallow were the worst affected. It was heartbreaking to witness the scenes of destruction of so many peoples' homes and to learn of the problems that were being experienced by many communities, businesses and farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very regrettable that we, the European Union, do not have a budget line to assist those who face these particular difficulties, despite my attempts and attempts by others over many years to get such a budget line instated. What I find puzzling about it is the damage it has done to areas of the economy where the European Union commits significant funds, particularly in relation to infrastructure. It is about time that we rectified it.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU, in cooperation with Member State governments, should initiate a preventative action programme to strengthen infrastructure in order to stop the same scale of destruction recurring in the future when extreme weather conditions prevail. The problem is that we know when these weather conditions are coming but no one seems to do anything to prevent the worst damage being inflicted.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem I would like to raise is the additional burden that the victims of these particular tragedies will also experience, the point mentioned by my colleague, Mr Deva, namely the refusal of many insurance companies to continue insurance cover. I wonder whether or not we, as a Union, could force these insurance companies under existing law to discharge what are essentially moral obligations, rather than do as they do at present and cherry pick and prefer a no-risk situation. However, if we cannot force them to do that then it is an area into which Member State governments must step, to see whether or not it is possible, under the umbrella of the EU, to oblige Member State governments to provide state cover. It is not fair that people should experience tragedies of this proportion and then face a very uncertain future when, given the climatic changes already taking place, there is an absolute certainty that the problems they have experienced over the last couple of weeks will recur, if not next year, then certainly in the years that follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Certain regions of Italy have suffered particularly badly for the second time in less than a month. The damage is considerable this time as well, people have died and the material damage has been enormous. In Liguria, in particular, entire plantations of specialised flower and fruit and vegetable crops have been destroyed and there has been a great deal of damage to seaside resorts, civil engineering works and factories, caused by storm surges as well as the floods. And given the remarkable scale of the disaster, the request made in the resolution which we tabled together with other groups is totally justified, despite the fact that these issues have been debated recently in this House – on 26 October to be precise – and that a Parliamentary resolution was adopted on that occasion as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the Commission to set aside part of its budget for emergency funds, so as to incorporate the interventions envisaged by the national authorities in the areas affected, and, pursuant to Article 87(2) of the Treaty on European Union, immediately to grant fitting financial assistance to the sectors affected by the disasters and, in general, to take into consideration the fact that the majority of the disaster areas are eligible for assistance from the existing funds: the Regional Fund, the EAGGF Guarantee Fund and the LIFE programme, which can provide a genuinely substantial contribution to the reconstruction work and restore the normal lives of the peoples who have been the victims of these disasters as soon as possible, but, above all, which can contribute to preventing further such damage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the Union does not restrict itself to making one-off interventions after disasters have occurred. Europe must remind the Member States to update their legislation on the environment, construction abuse, reforestation and the promotion of farming methods which seek not only to increase production quantities, but also to protect and replenish the land. Clearly, such large-scale action cannot be developed effectively at national level alone, due, primarily, to the amount of resources necessary but also because of the very nature of the natural disasters in question which, like those resulting from climate change, certainly have no respect for borders. With this resolution, we call for an urgent intervention contributing to repairing the damage and also for a longer-term policy to make Europe an increasingly safe and accommodating region for its citizens to live in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, throughout their various interventions, MEPs have concentrated on two quite different points: in the first place, the problem of climate change and, in the second place, what the Commission or the European Union can do in a situation like the present one, with the extremely serious floods that have occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first subject, I should like to point out that, as Parliament also does, we attach great importance to the problem of climate change and to the conference that is at this moment taking place in The Hague. We actively participated in the preparations for the conference and insisted that the European Union must assume a leading role in it.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with a number of assertions already made to the effect that we are in this way contributing to the protection of the environment and to the credibility of the environmental protocols with a view to their ratification in 2002. We are aware that the global destabilisation of the climate caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will be the most important challenge for Europe’s energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy and transport sectors produce 85% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union. It is therefore these industries which ought to be making a major effort to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Given its anticipated continuous growth – of more than 38% in the next decade – the transport sector will be that which requires the more important measures. On this basis, the Commission is shortly going to be proposing two strategic documents: a combination of policies and measures designed to provide a response to the Kyoto commitments and to the objectives regarding transport and energy. The first will deal with the security of the energy supply and the second with a revised common transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from environmental problems, however, I should also like to comment on what we are able to do at the moment. As you know, we have a basic difficulty: the legal basis for taking action. You know that, historically, there was a budget heading dedicated to emergency aid for populations in exceptional situations. This heading disappeared from the Budget some time ago on the basis of the argument that these were matters to which the subsidiarity principle applied and which ought to be raised at national, rather than Community, level. Ever since then, the Commission’s margin for manoeuvre has been very limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken two initiatives along these lines. One of these is very clear and is connected with civil protection: on 27 September 2000, we presented a draft Council decision for reinforcing Community instruments designed to coordinate the various systems of civil protection at European level. This will be effective in helping us solve problems, but it is not going to solve problems such as those we are creating now. All that we shall have left are the financing instruments that already exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ghilardotti raised the possibility of seeking funds. It is not so easy to do that. As you know better than anyone, funds are fully allocated and there are no generalised fund surpluses, even though there may be specific instances where there are no budgetary implementations. What is certain is that, if there is no legal basis for using these funds, it is very difficult to obtain them. The Commission’s proposal, which Commissioner Wallström explained in detail in this Parliament, is therefore to use the currently existing EAGGF funds, or the structural funds of the Interreg funds. The fact is that, in these cases, we cannot speak of actions of the Commission involving a global programme. Either we totally change the model or we shall have to think of the actions concerned as being at the request of the Member States and involving programmes or specific actions dependent upon the use of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As we said just now, we are entirely sympathetic to these practical projects, and I want to insist upon this point today, but it is absolutely essential to be able to rely on these proposals if we are to be able to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard, finally, to the possibility of using Article 87.2, established in the Treaty, as a basis for Community aid, I believe that this involves an extravagant interpretation of this article, and that is leaving aside the budgetary problems it would create. The article does not relate to Community aid, but relates to the compatibility of national aid with Community legislation. What this article says is that, in the case of natural catastrophes, national aid may be compatible. Each time the Commission has proposed the compatibility of such national aid following natural catastrophes, there has always been such compatibility. We are therefore entirely sympathetic to acting right now within the legal and budgetary margins available to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
