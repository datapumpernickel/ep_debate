Our main objective has been to draw up proposals for a common vision to govern the activities of Parliament, the Council and the Commission over the coming years. This vision will flesh out the partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security, which I announced here last July. It will identify the main economic, social and environmental challenges upon which our success will depend, and it will put forward priorities and solutions. It cannot be a unilateral exercise, however.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why this debate is important. This is why I am here today to listen to you. I want to hear Parliament’s proposals, as they will be an essential contribution to our joint thinking. I want to hear the concerns and, through you, to get to know the opinions of the millions of Europeans that you represent. Why is that so important? Because I am sure that the success of this Commission, of this Parliament and of the European project that we share depends on our showing that the European Union can make a difference, both within our borders and without.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as we are now preparing to ratify the European Constitution, we must not forget Europe’s remarkable achievements: half a century of peace and of social and economic development, as well as the recent enlargement representing the reunification of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, underestimate the challenges that we face and that require a Europe-wide response: the increasing age of our populations, the damage done to the environment and the effects of climate change, the need to adapt our economy to the competitive context of globalisation, and the threats to our peace and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today I do not intend to present a detailed account of our work in progress before listening to you; I would, however, like to outline the main elements of our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">To connect the European Union with its citizens we must earn the confidence of Europeans every day by providing answers to their concerns. Their main worries concern the economic and employment situation. There is no freedom, no future, if you are not able to earn a decent living and to secure the future of your children. We need a strong, stable and dynamic economy to generate more jobs and more opportunity. The main question is: how? We do not need another library of comprehensive studies to answer that question. The work has already been done. The Lisbon strategy is both a diagnostic and a list of tasks to perform. As I said in this House in July and in November, I intend to make it a top priority of the action of the Commission. A knowledge-based economy will be at the core of such a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being it may look too much like a catalogue of worthy aims, but the Commission wants to reshape it and transform it into a road map for prosperity, identifying clear objectives and a demanding calendar. This must be done with the Member States, who share the responsibility for implementation, and in a constructive dialogue with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic growth is not an end in itself. Europeans are concerned about the sustainability of our social model – our solidarity mechanisms, health and pension systems. They care about the quality of life and their environment. The only way to secure these goods is to generate the necessary resources to that end, and therefore to secure economic growth. Otherwise this will remain an affordable luxury for only some of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans are also concerned about their personal security. Crime is not limited to the boundaries of our Member States. Terrorism is the ugly face of globalisation. We need safer streets and a safer continent. The Commission will actively promote initiatives to provide our citizens with a better level of personal security and therefore of personal freedom. What are our means? We must back our ambition with the necessary financial resources at European and national level. We will not be a true Union without a vigorous cohesion policy. We must complete the internal market on the basis of clear and simple regulations. We need better regulation and have to be ready to roll back unnecessary red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also do this by supporting our strategic objectives with a new way of working inspired by the Constitution. All this must amount to a positive agenda for reform. But all this will not be achieved in a vacuum. The Union is not an isolated entity. It is not a fortress. A number of states want to join our Union. We should prepare ourselves to welcome them in the same way as they make efforts to meet our demanding standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have neighbours and we need to better structure our relationship with them, to tackle common problems and promote stability. We have partners in the entire world with whom we are united by strong cultural and economic ties. Europe cannot be selfish. We have a duty of solidarity with the poorest regions of the world, particularly Africa. Our values of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights imposes on us the responsibility of promoting them worldwide. Only by strengthening our values will we be able to defend our interests in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is present here today to listen to you. The Commission’s considerations will draw upon today’s debate, which will undoubtedly be of great assistance to us in proposing strategic priorities for the entire Union and in concluding the preparation of our work programme for the first year of this Commission. I shall present these proposals to you at the second plenary session of January. They will then have to be discussed by Parliament and by the Council so that agreement can be reached on the objectives and priorities for the Union during the first half of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say another word or two about my initiative to develop joint strategic objectives. One the one hand, the concept of multiannual planning is now enshrined in the Constitution. It has indeed already been put into practice with the Council and the last Parliament. For the time being, however, we are solely committed to coordinating the planning for the three institutions, without going as far as coordinating our strategic visions for the medium- and long-term future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, although it is true that the previous Commissions presented their vision, this did not always represent the expression of a real partnership with Parliament or the Council. The practical result was that Europe was being driven without a sufficiently clear roadmap, the consequence being that we were sometimes diverted from our route by external international events and that our priorities changed too much as a result of the political agendas of the different presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the very least, therefore, we are duty-bound to do our best to set the medium- and long-term priorities for the entire Union, by which I mean not just the priorities for our institution, but also the efforts that we must make to set priorities for the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our joint strategic objectives must act as a global navigation system for Europe for the next five years. It is clear that we must demonstrate flexibility and show ourselves to be capable of adapting to change. Nonetheless, our joint objectives will certainly help us to define priorities to be used later to assess the work of our institutions: the Commission, Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much looking forward to hearing your contributions and working with you to establish an ambitious agenda for the future of Europe.</p>

The difficult and sometimes dramatic weeks involved in confirming the Commission are behind us. It eventually got a resounding vote of confidence, and our Group voted for it with a large degree of unanimity. Now is the time to get down to work. Today’s debate is a quite new experience, and what makes it so is the fact that the Commission first listens to Parliament. Mr President of the Commission, I am very glad to hear you say that you wanted to hear what Parliament thinks about the work the Commission will be doing over the next five years. I am also glad to hear you say that you will be presenting your programme on 26 January and, in so doing, want to take into consideration as much as possible of what Parliament has to say. Even as I speak, we are endeavouring to put together this House’s common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group has tabled a motion for a resolution, which is currently being discussed with the other Groups. I hope that the House will be able to express an opinion, thus enabling the Commission and – it is to be hoped – the Council, to agree on a five-year programme. Our group believes that there are five main priorities: if we were able to implement them alone, we would do so, but we cannot, and that is why we always need to be willing to compromise. The first is economic reforms in the European Union to make for greater competitiveness and more prosperity for the public; the second is to improve security by combating terrorism and crime, securing the European Union’s external borders, preventing abuse of the asylum systems and fighting illegal immigration. I might add that this is something that matters also to people who enter the EU illegally, for what is going on in the Mediterranean, with thousands of people dying because the situation there remains unresolved, is a fundamental violation of human rights. We must join together in attempting to find solutions so that people no longer end up losing their lives in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is a stronger Europe in a safer world, creating greater stability and fostering democracy and human rights. Fourthly, there is a need to shape a policy that makes a clean environment possible and offers people a better quality of life. The fifth and final priority is to make the European Union more open, more receptive to new ideas and more democratic, to enable it to work better and with less red tape. What I ask of you, Mr President of the Commission, is that, whenever putting forward a proposal, you should ask yourself whether it makes for more bureaucracy, whether it contravenes the principle of subsidiarity, and how much it costs. What I ask, in other words, is that all these things should be taken into account in the Commission’s administrative practice as early as the stage at which proposals are presented.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three aspects on which I would like to focus rather more closely. It is Europe’s competitiveness that determines whether people in the European Union have work and the wherewithal to live. Our main concern must be to maintain and create jobs, and we can do that only if we make Europe more competitive. I would urge you, Mr President of the Commission, to be cautious in the language you use, for the language used in the Lisbon Declaration, according to which the European Union was to become the most dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, reminds me of Nikita Khrushchev, who, in the 1950s and 1960s, wanted to overtake the USA, and we know what became of that! So let us be modest in what we say, but ambitious in what we do. If you do that, you will be on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">By far the greater part of our Group takes the view that we must not jeopardise the stability criteria that underpin the Stability and Growth Pact, for new debts will have to be repaid tomorrow by those who are the young generation of today, something that would neither make economic sense nor be in line with the policy’s moral foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is important is the neighbourhood policy. I would like to encourage you to have us, during your presidency, taking initiatives in the Middle East, seeing as we do that the Americans cannot manage on their own. The Middle East is a region that is one of the European Union’s neighbours, and it is worthy of every effort on our part to establish stability and peace in it for both Israel and Palestine. We know how important all this is to peace and for the sake of good relations with the Arab and Muslim world. Our priority must be the adoption of the Constitution, on which the European Union’s peaceful and democratic action in the twenty-first century depends.</p>

Mr Barroso, I have not had the opportunity of speaking to you for a month, have positively longed to see you, and it is good that you are here to listen for ideas to take away with you. I am also glad to see Mrs Kroes sitting behind you; I will readily admit that it gave me pleasure to see that the first thing she has done, after all that has happened here, is to submit one of the decisions taken by Portugal’s Government under Mr Barroso to critical scrutiny – a good indication of her independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering’s references to Nikita Khrushchev are getting more frequent. The reason for this, which I can divulge to the House, is that Mr Poettering’s doctorate was on Konrad Adenauer’s security policy. Like much else in his politics, Adenauer’s security policy was guided by the motto of ‘no experiments’. I can tell Mr Poettering that ‘no experiments’ will not get the European Union very far. So let me encourage you, Mr Barroso, to be cautious only in the words you use, but bold in what your Commission proposes and in the initiatives it takes.</p>
<p class="contents">I want now to seize the opportunity to give you, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, three essential messages to take away with you; in previous debates, I have described them as the three key elements in our policy in this House. Before I repeat them, let me give you – for you are here to listen – some more good advice, which is that whatever initiatives you take will need broad majority support in this House. I therefore take it as read that you will take what the Socialist Group says on board and that it will also be reflected in the initiatives you put forward. You will of course understand that any programme from the Commission that is flawlessly constructed and draws on neo-liberalism or conservative thinking while devoid of any social democratic elements will not get any support from us. Let that be quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want economic policy in the European Union to be guided – as Mr Poettering put it – by economic reforms, then, just so we can make it clear where the faultlines are that divide consensus from conflict, I can tell you – Mr Poettering, Mr Barroso – that such economic reforms, always and above all, add up to one thing. They must, indeed, help to make the European Union more competitive, but they must also, and above all, help to promote social cohesion in Europe. The two are different sides of the same coin. Those who believe that competitiveness demands that Europe’s workers should have fewer rights will have energetic resistance from our Group to contend with. To take an example, the Services Directive will give you an early opportunity to show us whether this Commission is willing to bring the two together. Competitiveness must be emphasised as much as possible, but social cohesion is absolutely indispensable as the basis for everything we do.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering’s second point, in which he mentioned anti-terrorism in the same breath as asylum and immigration, struck me as combining two quite different phenomena in a dangerous way. Combating terrorism is one of the European Union’s core tasks, but please do not lump it together with illegal immigration and asylum policy. I am sure you do not in fact intend to do so, but please make the distinction! Counter-terrorism has little to do with asylum and immigration, but asylum and immigration form one single task, one of European policy’s pressing concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, Mr Barroso, I believe that the good proposals that have already been made – years ago, by Commissioner Vitorino as part of the Tampere process – should again feature in your programme. The Europe we expect – and this is what our group is striving for – is both humane and concerned to guard its citizens’ security, one whose external borders are secured as consistently as possible, but which also treats humanely those who need our protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about a clean environment and need a sustainable policy for it, but we also have to set out in plain terms what has again become apparent in Buenos Aires over the past week, that the failure of a sustainable worldwide policy for the environment is not the European Union’s doing. One of the Commission’s core tasks must be to spell out the fact that, for as long as the United States of America fails to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, for as long as it does nothing to help reduce the production of CO2, we Europeans must be tireless in demanding that it should do so. That is one of your core tasks as President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My third point, Mr Barroso, is another message for you as you prepare your programme; it has to do with Europe’s putting down roots and establishing its place in the world. A model of democracy founded upon multinationality and multi-ethnic structures, which is what the European Union is, can be a winner when it comes to exporting peace to the world, because balance and acceptance are at the heart of the European Union – the balance between large and small and the acceptance of minorities in particular. If you base Europe’s international policy on this message that we seek internal balance – as we are at the moment helping to do in Ukraine – and that we seek political rather than military solutions to ethnic conflicts, then you will always have the Socialist Group on your side.</p>

<p class="contents">Cohesion and social development are necessary, but do not take place in Europe today. A knowledge-based society is necessary, but is not a reality in Europe today. We have to increase funding for research and development and we also have to do a lot more work on lifelong learning. Technical development with regard to environmental concerns is necessary, and this does not take place in Europe today – at least not in the way it could and should.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamental human rights, the rule of law and gender equality are what the European citizen want to achieve: that is the sound basis of economic growth. I therefore urge you, Commissioner, not to mix up the fight against terrorism with human rights and the concerns for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, active participation in the labour market makes a substantial contribution to a decent standard of living, regional development and social cohesion, although investment in education and research, as well as government action in cases of serious market failure, also have a key role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Each minister of finance in Europe today is taken up to the mountain top with all the temptations of undermining the Growth and Stability Pact. Sometimes the reaction is the same as that of the famous Swedish actress who once said: 'I do not have to be drawn into temptation, I can walk by myself'. The ALDE Group firmly believes that a robust and dynamic economic environment in the European Union can only come about if the new Commission commits itself to reviewing the Stability and Growth Pact so that it provides a strong bulwark against fiscal irresponsibility, while maintaining the necessary flexibility to ensure that Europe maximises its growth potential without endangering price stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group is fully prepared to cooperate with the Commission along this very stony path that we have to walk together, but this must be based on sustainable development.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">on behalf of the Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that during today’s debate many fellow Members of various political groups, some of them quite unexpectedly, have spoken at length about sustainability. I believe that such interest is important, since I am sure that this issue will become a genuine priority for the Commission too.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when many citizens have a growing distrust of the European project, the main strategic objective of the new Commission and all the other Community institutions ought to be to return to being visibly effective in improving the quality of life for citizens, to become a positive instrument for democratic growth both within and outside the European Union and to transform the Union into an area of technological innovation focusing on ecological and social sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that three commitments are necessary to achieve these goals. The first relates to consistency in terms of the objectives established and the capacity to ensure they are achieved. Therefore, we strongly urge the Commission to be more determined in taking into account the EU’s key commitments, such as sustainability, social cohesion and gender equality, in all its policy proposals, and to make a real commitment to restoring a balance among the three Lisbon Agenda pillars – economic, social and environmental – in order to avoid promoting inflexible economic objectives at the expense of the quality of our citizens’ individual lives.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to put forward bold proposals for a coordinated effort to give fresh impetus to investment in environmental technologies and measures to promote employment. As far as competitiveness is concerned, we would like to see the relevant indicators extended to include qualitative, social and environmental indicators too, such as income distribution, poverty and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that consistency is also measured in terms of the capacity to ensure that the commitments undertaken are complied with. We know that a very large number of Member States are not complying with the Kyoto Protocol targets and we therefore believe that the ways in which the Commission will help these countries to comply with the protocol are an important ingredient in achieving consistency. On this point, we would like to relaunch our old proposal for a climate stability pact, which would lay down a joint management system for the Kyoto commitments that would be not merely repressive but also positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second commitment which we certainly must re-evaluate relates to having the courage to reject an easy conformism that ignores the European Union’s responsibilities in the world; we must, instead, make Europe a point of reference and a model for those in the rest of the world who are fighting to defend human rights and freedom. This point is extremely important to us. We cannot refrain from expressing our thoughts on human rights in China and Russia or on the war in Chechnya for commercial and economic reasons. We will soon be speaking again about the Dayton accords, now reaching their tenth anniversary. We need to take action on this point as well, and we hope that the Commission will be able to put forward some positive initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final commitment relates to the ability to truly represent the interests of the European Union as a union, by managing not to be overly influenced by the power relations between individual countries and with the Council in general, and by finding true alliances between those in the European Parliament, the voluntary sector and business who share the idea that the European Union is much more than the sum of the EU governments. To this end, we call upon the Barroso Commission to reconsider, and perhaps to withdraw, the Bolkestein directive, to defend the REACH directive tooth and nail, to put forward a new directive on services of general interest, to abandon or at least to review the former Commission’s policy on GMOs and to take a practical and courageous approach to opening legal immigration channels.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in conclusion I would like to mention at least four fundamental points in the interinstitutional agreement which we would like to enter into with you.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, of course, relates to the code of conduct for Commissioners and a serious approach to the issue of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concerns the issue of impact assessment. New laws should not be assessed arbitrarily but in a way that is based on uniformly applied criteria. The European Parliament is moving slowly on this front. We know that companies and the economic world in general are much more active in this field. We must encourage the Commission and Parliament to assess new laws on the criteria of sustainability and social impact as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point relates to the reopening of the issue of access to documents. We are extremely dissatisfied with the current situation and sincerely hope that in the coming years we will succeed in obtaining a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final point concerns a very complex issue, of which we will no doubt have occasion to speak again, which is the Commission’s attitude to contraventions of Community law by the Member States. We are extremely concerned about the delays that have built up and the fact that the Commission now seems to have practically abandoned this priority, particularly in the environmental field. We very much hope that in the future the Commission will reconsider this priority, since the credibility of the European Union also depends on its ability to ensure that its laws are obeyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, given the dominant political profile of the new Commission, it would be foolhardy of my group to ask it to implement a set of strategic orientations corresponding to our vision for Europe. Nonetheless, in view of the unexpected strength of the headwinds at the time of his investiture, I should like to recommend that Mr Barroso give his less fortunate fellow citizens a few clear signals to show that he has also heard what they have to say.</p>
<p class="contents">The first signal could relate to the draft directive on the liberalisation of services, commonly known as the Bolkestein Directive, to which Mr Schulz and Mrs Frassoni have referred. This text confirms all of the reservations towards the European liberal model held by the social movements, including the European Trade Union Confederation – and with good reason. At the very heart of the draft lies the infamous country of origin principle, which is intended to allow service providers to apply the social legislation in force in their home countries in all Member States. This would constitute a social dumping machine, a sort of flag of convenience covering all services. My belief is that such a measure will not be accepted by our fellow citizens. My request is therefore simple, Mr Barroso: withdraw the Bolkestein Directive and initiate a broad debate on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">A second signal could concern the plan to set up holding centres for refugees and migrants on the southern shore of the Mediterranean or in other countries outside the Union. This is an appalling plan. The last Commission legitimised this move, however, by initiating and financing pilot projects. Here again, my request is simple: put a complete end to these plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The third signal should, in our view, involve the interminable and dramatic conflict in the Middle East. The Union was jointly responsible for the roadmap providing for the creation of a Palestinian State in 2005. We are now at the end of 2004 and our undertaking is nowhere near even starting to be implemented. The main obstacle is Sharon. No other leader, except, no doubt, George Bush, could violate UN resolutions, scorn the Hague Court and snub the Union as he does without reprisals. The Commission has just proposed that he should form part of what one Commissioner has called a ‘ring of friends’ and benefit from the advantages of its new neighbourhood policy. It should be realised that this measure risks being grossly misunderstood by people who no longer support the policy of double standards. My request in this case, Mr Barroso, would be that you should remove all ambiguity in this area by answering a twofold question: what are you going to require of Mr Sharon and what measures do you recommend if he persists in ignoring you?</p>
<p class="contents">Your responses to these three points will certainly be followed very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You talked this morning about leading in Europe, and there is much talk of five-year plans, of the great visions that you have; but it seems to me that you have one or two problems. There is the problem of legitimacy, and the Commission has the problem of credibility. On whose authority are you people the government of Europe? I certainly have never been asked whether that is what I want. The total failure of the hearings of the Commissioners that went through this Parliament has cast a very dark shadow over your Commission. You know as well as I do that the gap between what you want and what the ordinary voters want is getting wider. That is why the turnout in the European elections in June was down to a record low. People know that the Lisbon agenda is nothing more than a joke and that the economic model in the European Union is simply not working.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the Constitution and the referendums that we are going to have offer us both a chance for a solution; but they must be free and fair referendums. I would like your assurance that any information that goes out to Member States in which there are going to be referendums presents both sides of the argument, so that we can have a free and fair result. Not to do so is to risk long-term public contempt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will start with economic issues. The Lisbon strategy is a splendid idea, but it has to be remembered that if Europe is to compete with the rest of the world, its economy must be soundly based on freedom. Much has been said in this House about the need for a knowledge-based economy and for an economy based on social values, and rightly so. Nonetheless, unless Europe’s economy is based on freedom, it will be unable to compete successfully with the rest of the world. Mr Poettering seemed to be of the same mind, and I endorse the views he expressed. Mr Farage took the words out of my mouth, and there was sound common sense in what he said too. We must say yes to economic freedom, and it must have priority over everything else.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the environment, Mr Barroso. It certainly is crucially important to protect the environment. We must say yes to environmental protection, but no to ideological <span class="italic">diktats</span>. It is not acceptable to be hemmed in by screens when driving through some beautiful German countryside, yet this is what happens to me twice a week. The screens have not been installed for the benefit of human inhabitants, but to prevent any possible disturbance to animals. As a result, I am prevented from admiring the landscape, and that is not acceptable. The wind generators one cannot fail to notice when travelling through the beautiful countryside in the Black Forest area are a similar case. These useless loss-making monsters are actually subsidised by the German Government and the European Union. Quite simply, they are detrimental to the environment. It is important to bear in mind the visual aspect of the environment and not to equate environmental issues with the defence of all conceivable animal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards social issues, it must be remembered that there is more to them than democracy and tolerance. Moral values also have an important role to play. I am bound to say, Mr Barroso, that you gave in to pressure from the Left when you undertook your reshuffle to come up with a new Commission-designate. Your actions do not bode well for the future of moral values in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to foreign policy, its scope has to be broader than Turkey and North Africa, Mr Barroso. I am well aware that citizens of the old Union holiday in those countries. I also realise that citizens of the old Union meet people from those countries as they go about their daily lives back in Europe. It must be understood, however, that foreign policy also involves what lies beyond the Union’s eastern border. Until recently, that was deemed to be the single huge area of Russia. That is not the case. There are countries other than Russia across that border, and I have in mind Ukraine in particular. Ukraine is a free nation and wishes to remain one. You spoke of showing solidarity with Africa, Mr Barroso. Subsidies are not the best way of doing so, as they are mere drops in the ocean. The best way of demonstrating solidarity is by withdrawing subsidies from European agriculture. African countries would then be able to compete and build a better future for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, it is essential to be guided by moral principles and common sense if we<span class="bold"> </span>are to come up with something more than empty phrases. I trust you will bear this in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to ask your Commission, perhaps in collaboration with the Council, to give a clear message, as soon as possible, to all citizens of the European Union as to what will happen if the European Constitution is not ratified in the next two years in one single country. I realise that the major political forces in this Parliament consider it to be just a matter of course that the European Constitution will be ratified in all twenty-five countries, but I can assure you that the reality is different in my country. I am not saying that the Constitution will not be ratified, but nobody there is looking it at as a forgone conclusion that it will be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">There is at present a sort of legal vacuum here, similar to when the initial proposals for the composition of your Commission was not ratified, and nobody is able to give a clear answer as to what will happen. It is being said that if the Constitution is not approved in the countries of the former fifteen the process will start again from the beginning. It is being said that if it is not approved in the new ten the same process as in Nice will be followed, namely the referendums will be repeated a year later in those countries. I do not think that the new countries are so inferior that there should be these two different outcomes, and I think that the citizens of the European Union deserve a clear answer as to what will happen if the European Constitution fails to go through in one single country.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one further point. At the present time, the adopted European Constitution also includes clearly established Financial Perspectives, drawn up by the European Commission for the period 2007-2013. I therefore consider it to be of the utmost importance that both the citizens and this Parliament should be given an answer as to what will happen if the European Constitution does not come into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Szájer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(HU)</span> One of the chapters of the proposal for a decision put forth by the European People’s Party and European Democrats is about how to get Europe closer to its citizens. I firmly believe that establishing the Commission is in itself a step towards bringing European institutions closer to the citizens. The European Parliament is the only directly-elected body of the European Union, and with the election of the European Parliament and the establishment of the Commission, a clear and unequivocal direct link has been established for the first time in the sense that the parties with the most votes will have a more definite say in the Commission’s decisions on the issues that concern the citizens of Europe the most.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the European People’s Party and European Democrats, there are three fundamentally important questions to be addressed by the new Commission over the next five years: competitiveness, cohesion and security, all of which have been mentioned by the President of our party. I believe that growth, the encouragement of small and medium-sized enterprises and consequently job growth, research and development are fundamental goals of Europe that promote the welfare of European citizens. As far as research and development are concerned, let me add that it is the European People’s Party’s determined policy to promote ethical research. As to security, I would like to point out to the President as well, that if we examine the question of security from the European citizens’ viewpoint, then crime, crime that crosses borders, illegal immigration and terrorism are indeed interrelated questions. It is by no means an accident that notions of freedom, security and justice are so strongly dependent on each other and from the citizens’ point of view they are downright inseparable.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and perhaps most important task is cohesion, the creation of European unity. The newly-established European Commission inherited the pre-existing situation of an expanded Europe and if you are from one of the new Member States, you sometimes have the impression here in Parliament and also in other European institutions, that Europe, the European Union, has not fully realised the scale of its expansion yet. New opportunities for a united Europe need to be created, and further steps need to be taken to ensure the success of this enterprise, which is the greatest expansion of the European Union to date. This is not only in the vital interest of citizens from new Member States, but also in the interest of those from existing members. Therefore, cohesion policy must be improved and expansion must be consolidated. The expansion has only been completed from a legal point of view. There is still a lot to do on the social and economic front and the European Union must help new states catch up and provide the means to create unity within the European Union. With the expansion, the European Union has become a much more diverse place, but its problems have also become more diverse. These problems need to be solved and the new questions, such as minority rights, warrant adequate, joint European answers. I would like to emphasise the question of the Romany minority and all those that may be addressed with the help of the Commission, the cooperation of European institutions and by taking into account the opinion of the directly-elected members of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, and as you yourself said, Europe needs the Lisbon strategy to become a reality. It must be practical, and it must be focused. We propose to you a five-year programme in which Europe’s development of the Lisbon strategy is placed within a time frame as specific as the one devised when we duly created the internal market in 1992. Secondly, we need a new European multiannual growth strategy with stronger coordination of the national governments’ public investment programmes. By doing things simultaneously, we achieve a far greater impact. Thirdly, we need a Commission proposal that can strengthen companies’ social responsibility, especially in the light of outsourcing and the major problems involved in European conversion. Fourthly, we need to strengthen gender equality in the work place. Fifthly, we need to double the sustainable energy objectives for 2020 from 6 % to 12%. If we act single-mindedly, we can actually do this. Sixthly, we need the Commission’s programme genuinely to give higher priority to research, development and training within the financial estimates. Seventhly, we need a European Agency for Fundamental Rights. Eighthly, we need a charter for services of general interest that can establish the principles governing citizens’ rights in the modern welfare state. Ninthly, Mr Barroso, we need a list of common principles governing ‘best practice’ when it comes to the exchange of information about the integration of immigrants into our society. Tenthly, and finally, we need, as you yourself said, to show more solidarity. We need the Commission to present an ambitious plan to the European Council by June 2005 to increase EU aid to developing countries, a plan to ensure that, in 2009, we make an overall contribution of 0.5% of GDP and that we establish a ‘road map’ to achieve 0.7% in 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I have very quickly mentioned a number of the important points I believe are fundamental to the success of the Commission’s work. We need good speakers, but we also need practical action. When I listen to your contribution in this House today, I see that such ambition is present. We shall assess your work on the basis of the practical action taken. I look forward to sensible cooperation in people’s best interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us imagine the Commission as Santa Claus and me as a little boy. I will have to give some more thought to the role to be played by the Council, and will leave you to imagine it as Rudolf or as Santa’s little helpers.</p>
<p class="contents">I now have the difficult task of drawing up my wish list, and top of the list is that I, along with all other MEPs, should no longer be denied the right of codecision in matters of justice and home affairs. This is an important field for the EU, and one in which this House expects, from 2005, to be fully involved, for our European society is founded upon the rule of law, and every citizen allows himself to be guided by the standards set by the Community, believing as he does that these have been examined and approved by the majority of his legitimate representatives. My wish is that that belief should become reality.</p>
<p class="contents">My second wish is that we should all play by the same rules – rules that we have made for ourselves. I think we can no longer tolerate the situation in which national governments, in love with their own grandeur, circumvent the institutions they created. When a handful of European interior ministers take decisions as a clique, they treat European democracy with contempt. Both Tampere and the Hague Programme are good examples of a Community approach that involves everyone. My wish is that we should press on with this open dialogue instead of forming ourselves into small clubs.</p>
<p class="contents">My third wish is that due account be taken of the need for data protection. It is time that the third pillar included an instrument comparable to Directive 95/46/EC on data protection. I would like Commissioner Frattini to remember that he has indicated his agreement to this.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth wish – and my last for today – is that the European Union should face terrorism head-on, and that it should show that democracy also means the defence of democracy. The European Union must demonstrate that it is more than equal to those who seek to send freedom up in flames. A victory for terrorism means the destruction of free society, and that is something we must neither aid nor abet. I would like to see the Commission valuing and maintaining fundamental democratic principles, the freedom of the individual, and giving due weight to data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the wish lists I have seen and heard so far are not as short as that, but for all those who wrote them they are expressions of hope. My hope is that what I want for Christmas will not be buried under a snowdrift thrown up by political aberrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like Mr Alvaro I was struck by our proximity to Christmas. All the good little boys and girls have drawn up their Christmas lists and instead of sending them to Lapland we are sending them to the Berlaymont. Mr Barroso, it is up to you to find out in January whether you have been Father Christmas or Scrooge. However, I hope you will make all our Christmases merry and bright.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to paragraph 3 in the Christmas list in the name of Mrs Frassoni and Mr Cohn-Bendit and the reference to the subsidiarity protocol, which is the biggest opportunity your Commission has to put meaning to the often empty phrases about subsidiarity and bringing Europe closer to the people. The subsidiarity protocol represents an opportunity for the Commission to do something brave and new. It is perfectly possible for the Commission to act as if the protocol were in force from this afternoon. Regardless of any decision on the Constitution itself, this Commission could act in a way totally unlike its predecessors and involve the relevant institution at the relevant time, regardless of whether or not it is a nation-state parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, until five years ago, my own country, Scotland, had no parliament. Now we have a parliament, a government and a civil service with near total power over health, education, justice, home affairs, the environment and many other areas. The only thing we do not control is money, which, as colleagues will be aware, is a subject close to any Scotsman's heart. However, we are bigger than Ireland and have more people than Denmark. The relevant institution for the Commission to deal with in Scotland is the European Parliament and the Scottish Parliament and yet our flag is not there. We are firmly in the second class when it comes to relations with Europe and yet we could contribute so much.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge you, Mr Barroso, to make our Christmas merry and bright and use your Commission and the subsidiarity protocol to put meaning to the phrases about subsidiarity, about bringing Europe home, because you will gain, we will gain and Europe will gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me cite three examples from Part III: Article 177/78, which lays down the principle of an open market economy with free competition; Article 147/48 which downgrades services of public general interest guaranteed by individual states; and Article 203, which makes employment policy subordinate to economic policy. The result of this is merciless competition to undercut in social terms, in environmental terms, and as regards protection in the workplace. Everything the Commission does is done according to the same blueprint; you ask for a navigation system, but you already have one, in the shape of the directive on services, the directive on ports, and the third railway package.</p>

We are also all citizens with different views of the Constitution. According to both the EC Treaty and the Constitution, we are all equal before the law. Nonetheless, all the EU bodies now propose that we who are opposed to the Constitution should pay subsidies to those who are in favour of it. There are major hearings to which no opponents of the Constitution are invited. There are major subsidies to the European movement and to think-tanks that think alike, and now millions of euros for propaganda. It is undemocratic, improper, in conflict with the principle of equality and, therefore, illegal. I do not understand how the Commission’s clever Swedish Vice-President can put her name to a communications strategy that will impose a particular view of the Constitution upon people.</p>
<p class="contents">The public authorities have just one task: to publish the draft Constitution and the alternative produced by the Convention, preferably in reader-friendly editions for every possible target group. Opinions should be left to a free press, the political organisations and parties, citizens’ initiatives and interested parties. States should not have opinions, and constitutions should have no specific political content. A state is a tool for all the citizens. A constitution should merely create ground rules for bringing the laws into being. It is up to the people to decide the political complexion of the laws, whether they are to be adopted in Brussels or by the national parliaments and whether they are good or bad. It is totalitarian to want to give the state a specific opinion and lock people into a specific policy. Mrs Wallström can scarcely sell that project to the electorate. She would do much better to stick to her own proposal, which is much more reminiscent of Grundtvig’s message of ‘freedom for Loki as well as for Thor’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us quickly clear away any misunderstandings. No one is intending – and the Commissioner responsible has done well in confirming this emphatically – to think up a reform to get around the Maastricht criteria. Rigour in complying with the Treaty and a commitment to a progressive reduction of deficits remain the objectives needed to make Europe economically credible and stable. I believe, however, that it is possible to have a debate on the operational criteria for achieving the objective of deficit reduction, and to think not so much in terms of a reform as of a transformation of the Pact, one that can reconcile budget rigour and flexibility in order to give renewed impetus to growth, development, employment and, finally, the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Government has done its thinking, and has not gone unheard. Faced with considerable concerns over the excessively high rate of the euro and the loss of Europe’s competitiveness compared with the United States and emerging countries, the proposal could be to remove investments in infrastructure and research from the calculation of national budgets. In simple terms, this means introducing the golden rule to achieve the goal of budgetary consolidation without compromising the recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Pact can no longer content itself with being merely a pact for stability, and unfortunately also a pact for economic stagnation, but must become a pact for competitiveness, for structural reform and, above all, a pact to guarantee a future for our children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first experimental and very clear aim will be the Constitutional Agreement mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Bobošíková.

For the first time, you are President of the Commission of the enlarged Community. I would ask you to make use of the potential offered by the ten new Member States in the shape of their Commissioners so that you too can tear down that virtual frontier that exists between the old and the new Europe. A momentous period lies ahead of you; the fulfilment of your aims, the fulfilment of the trust we placed in you when we voted for you, but, of course, this also applies to us as our assistance will be required in all of this.

The free movement of people is nothing more than an empty phrase if it is not accompanied by matching health cover provision.

Tinkering with small matters eats away at both the Commission’s and Parliament’s credibility. One important area of focus with regard to policy is, unquestionably, security. We need to tackle the issue of security as a broad concept, like peace in Europe or peace in the world. More than anything, however, we need to tackle the issue of security at the level of the individual. Our citizens must feel that their lives and living conditions are safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important area of focus is something that is often mentioned here: competitiveness. In this respect, the Lisbon strategy is of key importance. The President of the Commission presented a list of tasks in connection with Lisbon and it must actually be implemented; it cannot be allowed to remain just a ‘wish list’.</p>
<p class="contents">An essential ingredient in competitiveness is our need to create conditions that spawn new companies in Europe, which in turn generate new jobs. These we need in order to achieve vital economic growth. A stable, healthy and growing economy nevertheless requires instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact. We must fearlessly adhere to that at all costs, and all countries should comply with it, both big and small.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to refer back to yesterday’s debate on Turkey. If enlargement comes about too quickly, it might lessen our chances of achieving the results we want to see in the economy and with regard to security. This in turn would increase public opposition to the EU. Enlargement should therefore proceed at a sensible, controlled pace.</p>

On the one hand, the European Union appeals to the outside world – consider Ukraine, the Southern Caucasus, Turkey, to which reference has just been made, but also the migration that is going on, the fact that Europe is a destination for all, or many, states or individuals. On the other hand, we find ill-feeling, disappointment, and a bad atmosphere in Europe itself. In many cases, it will be for the Vice-President of the Commission and her public relations work to deal with that, but the Commission as a whole, along with Parliament, must work at resolving this contradiction. This does of course tie in with what previous speakers have already mentioned, namely the fact that many members of the public believe that nothing positive is being done about reinforcing and modernising the European model – which is what we wanted to express in the resolution on which we will be voting – but rather that it is being dismantled.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether that actually is the case, I do not propose to consider, but people feel that social rights are being reduced, that social options are being cut back, and that there are also not enough jobs for people to earn enough money and amass sufficient financial resources to keep themselves and their families. I believe that the public’s perception that the social model or the European model are in danger imperils the European Union as a whole. Even where it is globalisation or new forms of competition, which actually have no direct connection with the European Union, that are bringing this situation about, and threatening people’s living conditions, it is often the European Union that is blamed, and that is why we must do everything in our power to really make a success of Lisbon, so that the people can identify with the European model. We are not dealing here with abstract concepts, but with things that are very real.</p>
<p class="contents">As reference has already been made to the Services Directive, let me say that I think that it, in the form in which it has been presented, may well be an example of how ordinary people can come to believe what they do. A lot of people are afraid not only that their social rights or their rights as employees are now being eroded, but also that the same thing is happening to their rights as consumers, quite simply because the principle has gained acceptance that, in future, the lowest consumer standards should prevail and become normative across Europe instead of higher, or perhaps even the highest, consumer standards.</p>
<p class="contents">So, even though it is now for us to work on it, I ask you too to consider whether a different approach might be taken in future, one using something other than the principles contained in the Services Directive. Let me say, by way of a final comment, that we all agree on the need to reduce bureaucracy and over-regulation, but, if you will just take a look at the legal opinions on how the Services Directive is to be interpreted, you will see that to say so amounts to mere pious platitudes and that the reality is rather different. That being so, Mr Barroso, I urge you and your Commission to get back to supporting and reinforcing the European model of social and economic policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We expect you to further shape the Africa policy without losing sight of promoting democracy, the rule of law and human rights. We also expect the Commission to continue the policy of Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler in terms of world trade.

In many different ways, this House is reminding President Barroso of the fact that, under pressure from the European Parliament, he has made far-reaching promises at times. I should particularly like to draw your attention to one of those pledges, namely his promise to commit himself actively to the protection and promotion of basic rights, equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination. We take the view that the Commission should shape this policy in such a way that the European Union does not redraw ethical boundaries. The fight against discrimination should not result in the squeezing out of biblically-founded views about marriage and the view that life is worth protecting.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to ask the new Commission to hold back as regards the ratification of the European Constitution. This ratification is, and will continue to be, a matter for the national states. The Commission should keep well away from a unilateral campaign in favour of the European Constitution. Needless to say, the Commission’s contribution to boost turnout at national referendums should also benefit those voting against it. In a real democracy, they too should be taken entirely seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though Parliament, the Commission and the Council have failed to even make a start on a debate about Europe’s boundaries, accession negotiations will almost certainly be opened with Turkey, a non-European country, and one which, by the time it actually accedes, will have more than 80 million inhabitants. What fine strategic thinking that is!</p>
<p class="contents">We are still in the dark as to how much this accession will cost, never mind <span class="italic">who</span> will be footing the bill. It is a telling fact that a country such as the United Kingdom should be backing Turkey’s accession all the way, while at the same time refusing to budge on its rebate. The same is also true, in fact, of a number of other net contributors.</p>
<p class="contents">Substantial research has still not been done into the effects of immigration from Turkey. The EU is becoming ever more estranged from its people. We are told <span class="italic">ad nauseam</span> that we must bring Europe closer to the citizen, but when push comes to shove, nothing is done. The Turkey issue is a perfect illustration of this. It is a perfect opportunity to ask the public for their opinion, and yet it is unlikely that a referendum will be held in any of the Member States. Commissioner Michel explained why that was when he was still Foreign Affairs Minister in Belgium. He said that a referendum about an issue of this kind would open a debate with vicious arguments about Islam, among other things, which would only play into the hands of Right-wing parties. According to him, our western democracies would not have the wherewithal to control and frame a public debate on subjects of that kind.</p>
<p class="contents">This anti-democratic creed is quite simply perplexing. We should in any event thank Mr Michel for his frankness. He has stated out loud what many of his fellow Commissioners are thinking privately. Europe has a serious problem where its democratic legitimacy, and its being held accountable, are concerned, and there looks to be no sign of improvement in the near future – quite the reverse, in fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope, Mr President, that the Commission as a whole will succeed in finding what those who enter the life of an institution with energy and a desire for reform always have the greatest difficulty in finding: the right distance between realism and utopia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the search for that constant balance – which some call common sense – that for the last fifty years has enabled Europe to develop the social model that is the driving force behind Europe’s identity. The essential components of the model have been peace, prosperity and the convergence of cultures, and it has proved to be a winning model.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we are faced with a reality in which there have recently appeared a number of hitherto unknown aspects: a worrying demographic situation together with unprecedented technological evolution, one of the principal factors to have consolidated the phenomenon that has made the world a smaller place: globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, for Europe to remain an area that lives up to the winning model, we must wholeheartedly accept the inevitability of carrying out reforms that will first and foremost enhance our competitiveness. That means the opening-up of markets, increased productivity, more and better research, more innovation and greater investment in people and ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">The reforms that Europe needs must not, however, be seen as a task for the Commission alone. In my view, the most critical point in the period of reform that is now beginning is rather the commitment of the Member States and their willingness to take risks in putting these reforms into practice. Only with strong commitment from the Member States can the most dynamic sectors of society and the middle-tier authorities be encouraged to take part; without their participation no reform will be possible. This is also an area in which I believe Parliament should take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We share this aim, in particular as regards growth and employment, and, in order to restore confidence among the citizens of the European Union, the Union must clearly demonstrate its capacity to revive our economy. The debate will, of course, revolve around the strategy and the means for restoring our competitiveness. When you present your proposals in January, our group will be listening particularly attentively to your Commission’s choice of economic strategy. In this context, a number of speeches have referred to a link between the economic dimension, the social dimension and the environment, which is, I believe, no more than rhetoric and masks a real difference in approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, it is the Lisbon strategy that represents the path to follow. You mentioned the objective of a competitive, knowledge-based economy and we go along with that. We believe that, in choosing an economic strategy, we are choosing a social model and if we choose an economic strategy that is only based on liberalisation, this will be at the expense of the social model. We do not subscribe to the idea that the social aspect will simply follow on later.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall naturally refer to the example of the directive on services. If the price to be paid for developing the internal market in services is that our social services – our health services – are to be deregulated, that a number of services of general interest are to be put at risk and that employment law is under threat as a result of the country of origin rule, then I do not believe the return of competitiveness will in itself allow us to retain elements of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">The Clinton years in the United States showed that it is possible to have economic growth rightly based on investment in the knowledge economy and in new technologies, but without pulling the social model up with it, since the President did not, at that time, have a majority in Congress or political support for the implementation of a social policy that would provide for such a balance. We believe, on the contrary, that investment in social aspects, investment in public services and infrastructure and high environmental standards can be factors of production and competitiveness and can contribute towards success in international competition from the European Union’s point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore serious about this interdependence of the economy, social aspects and the environment. We could give examples of this and we shall do so in the dialogue with you in January. The need to increase the employment rate and the rate of labour participation will accordingly be among the subjects raised. Let us look at the sections of society worst affected. Women constitute one such category. It is in those countries that have invested in public amenities, such as crèches and in training that the employment rate among women tends to be higher. .</p>
<p class="contents">We could also mention other vulnerable sections of society, such as the many children from disadvantaged, in particular immigrant, backgrounds, who not only face racism and discrimination but also suffer from gaps in their education. What must also be borne in mind is the need to reduce frictional unemployment and the fact that there have been a number of successes, for example in the Scandinavian countries, achieved thanks to investment in training.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that you will have to prove that you are capable of improving the quality of social dialogue, which will ensure greater involvement among employees in their companies’ development. Against this backdrop, we also await an initiative with regard to the revision of the directive on European works councils, which is now experiencing enormous delays compared to the other directives on information and consultation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe and America diverge on a clutch of important questions: trade; science; fundamental rights; climate change; monetary policy; competition policy; foreign, security and defence policy and the Constitution.

<p class="contents">Such an objective cannot, however, be achieved without giving renewed impetus to basic research and innovation which, in turn, makes it necessary to put greater resources into facilities, infrastructure and European centres of excellence and to target the improvement of human capital by bringing in thousands of young researchers. This step change necessitates a rise in research investment to 3 per cent, at the level both of individual Member States and of the European Union as a whole. The Prodi Commission’s proposal aimed at an expenditure ceiling of 1.24 per cent of gross national income, but some major EU countries have already publicly set a maximum limit of 1 per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a severe restriction of Community financial resources is likely to have the concrete result of penalising many high-priority policies, including the cohesion policy, the rural development policy and the funding of training and research programmes, to which development policies are increasingly closely linked.

I shall now make my comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Not a single European Union competence has been devolved to the Member States since the principle of subsidiarity was announced. It is high time we took subsidiarity seriously, and took the Member States seriously too. It is time to recognise that Member States must not be dictated to over issues they are very well able to settle for themselves. Indeed, excessive regulation is the next issue I would like to mention. We must stop regulating everything. That is the socialist approach, and socialism has been proven to fail people. The Member States need to regain their freedom. My third comment is that the worst type of regulation is to be found in the common agricultural policy, which should be done away with. It is unfair to poorer Member States, especially to countries that were previously part of the Soviet bloc. There is one notable exception to this rule, however. The former German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, received the same treatment as members of the old Fifteen from the moment it joined the Union. Unequal treatment of this kind must cease. Why should a Polish farmer receive worse treatment that one in the former East Germany? The common agricultural policy is also unfair to poor countries outside the Union, and it should simply be dispensed with. Farmers within and without the Union should be granted freedom and equality. My last comment concerns the approaching referendums on the Constitution. Care must be taken to ensure that they are democratic, and that both supporters and opponents of the Constitution enjoy equal rights and equal access to the public media. It is all well and good to support democracy in Ukraine, Iraq and Palestine, but first and foremost we must nurture it amongst ourselves.</p>

Firstly, give back the people of Europe their confidence in a Europe of peace, freedom and justice. What do I mean by that? I mean that everyone should have to abide by common rules, that all must obey the Treaties, that all must implement decisions, that the Commission must avail itself more of its right of initiative and must monitor more. The rules are sufficient, but there is a lack of political will and determination. Words such as ‘infringement proceedings’, ‘Stability and Growth Pact’, ‘Lisbon’ and ‘Barcelona’ spring to mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I urge you to withdraw Commissioner Almunia’s proposal on the Stability and Growth Pact, which weakens the Commission and Community law. The common rules need to be reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, do not let what you do be influenced by those who break the rules, but take initiatives to do away with unanimity in the Council, so that your success or failure is not determined by those who block progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, make Europe more competitive in line with Lisbon and Barcelona, and take initiatives to remove from the internal market all barriers, blockages and distortions of competition. We need a stronger Commission, we need more Europe, and we need more initiatives from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, let us not just train researchers, but also let them carry out research into things that are usable!</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, make Europe more secure and stronger on the world stage, with the common foreign and security policy, the common defence policy, a common asylum and immigration policy, and a stronger United Nations. What we need is not for Germany to have the right of veto in the Security Council, but for the European Union to be a permanent member of it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The sixth thing I urge is that we should make informed participants of the people of Europe. There is not enough European consciousness in the Member States, which use a double strategy to weaken it. Let us make it impossible to shift the blame on to the EU; this will involve you, Mr President of the Commission, putting a European information and communication strategy on the table after every summit, so that what you have achieved cannot be claimed by the nation states.</p>

I have no doubt that we will have many meetings discussing the EU’s external policy and security policy in the coming years. In my view, the Commission, and also its President, play a major role in controlling policy cohesion and must ensure that the Commission’s tasks and the Council’s responsibilities are coordinated effectively. What is important in this is, of course, the correct use of all instruments which the European Union has at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, we relied on the excellent relationship between Commissioner Patten and High Representative Solana. However, we are now heading for a slightly different scenario, one that has been provided for in the Constitution. What we mainly expect, and ask, from the Commission is, pending the adoption and ratification of the Constitution, is that it should continue to work in the same spirit and now to look for a model of integration in which the scope of the different pillars, namely the first, second and third pillars, can be combined.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that is of importance to us is the EU’s commitment to promoting effective multilateralism. This has to do with the Commission’s contribution to the EU’s international relations. We would also like the Commission to devote much of its attention to fleshing out the civilian aspects of the EU’s security policy; I should also like the Commission to return to pledges it has made in the past with regard to reinforcing the EU’s action in conflict prevention. Furthermore, I think it is important to enter into a debate with the United States about the UN’s future. That is a very topical issue, in respect of which the Commission can be expected to make an active contribution. That should be a new element in the transatlantic dialogue. As far as we are concerned, making the world more democratic – starting with Europe, of course – is the leitmotif.</p>
<p class="contents">I can be brief about the third point. The EU’s enlargement and the Commission’s commitment to negotiations with Turkey, which we discussed this week, will be important tasks in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point concerns the relationship with Russia, a resolution on which will be adopted this week. How can we develop the relationship with that country along twin tracks, on the one hand, economic cooperation and working on common energy policy, and on the other hand, an open debate about values, democracy and the developments in Russia in this area? In our view, a lively debate about the relationship between the EU and Russia is inevitable, as well as a discussion about the neighbours we have in common, which should touch on Russia, Moldova, the Caucasus and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end with a remark in connection with the new neighbours. We believe that the people in Ukraine have sent out a clear message. What will be the EU’s response after the third round of the presidential elections? We see the new neighbourhood policy, in its current set-up, is an inadequate match for what is developing over there. I think that the EU’s action plans, in the framework of the new neighbourhood policy, must be linked more closely to the European aspirations that were very prominent in Ukraine. I think that that requires a fresh debate in Parliament. In short, with regard to the new neighbours, there is a need for a more comprehensive concept, a European <span class="italic">Ostpolitik</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is reasonable for the Commission’s main emphases to reflect the message that has emerged in connection with these events. I therefore want the guidelines to send out a clear political signal worthy of the unique situation in which Europe finds itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We have promised that the divided Europe will grow together. The most important emphasis should therefore be to bridge the gulf. Differences in health must be evened out. We want companies that operate across the borders and even out the economic differences.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve that, we must fully exploit the opportunities provided by structural and research policy. The Baltic must become the world’s cleanest sea, meaning that there must be an end to the emissions from Saint Petersburg. We want a top quality, dynamic research society in the Baltic Sea region, and there are surely corresponding expectations further south. We must construct a legal area in which everyone feels protected by law, irrespective of where they are in the area of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need a consistent and vigorous policy towards the EU’s Eastern neighbours too. The crisis in Ukraine has revealed the weaknesses in our neighbourhood policy. The EU must also tighten up its strategy and be consistent in its policy towards the countries of the Caucasus, Moldova and Russia. These are precisely the issues also touched upon by Mr Wiersma.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy for me to concur with Commission President Barroso’s words in the French part of his speech: <span class="italic">‘Nous devons fixer les priorités pour l'ensemble de l'union’ </span>[we must set priorities for the whole of Europe]. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While the updating of the Lisbon strategy is being debated, however, concrete choices are being made which can indicate a move in a particular direction. On this point, I would like to mention two actual examples. The first example is a proposal for a directive, the so-called Bolkestein directive, which in our opinion ought to be rejected. It is an outright collection of negative contents mixed up together, which would lead to an outright jungle where the fundamental rights of workers and citizens to high-quality services would be simultaneously violated, and it is therefore quite rightly opposed by the trade unions and by a wide range of social partners; we call for its withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is the proposal for the REACH regulation, designed to reform our chemical industry in terms of quality and health and safety, and we strongly call for it to be adopted speedily. These are two concrete choices which demonstrate two different conceptions of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As coordinator for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to focus on one crucial priority: the internal market. I want to say in response to previous remarks – it is a pity that some speakers have already left – that the Commissioner's support for the Internal Market Services Directive is very welcome because it is a fundamental part of completing the internal market. Sixty percent of the European economy is taken up by services and we have a complete network of anti-competitive restrictions among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, do not withdraw the directive: make it better. I am afraid to say that some of my colleagues are still living in the past and calling it the 'Bolkestein Directive'. I hope, first of all, that they might move with the times and consider calling it the 'McCreevy Directive', but maybe with your endorsement it could become the 'Barroso Directive'. Who knows?</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a second important point about internal market strategy. We have to make the rest of the internal market <span class="italic">acquis</span> work better for consumers and businesses. Aside from the Internal Market Services Directive, we do not want a lot more legislation during your Commission in the internal market area. What we want you to do is to put some serious enforcement and simplification behind the existing internal market directives. On the ground, businesses find many of the European directives much too complicated; in many cases there are inconsistencies between them. The objectives on the environment and social policy are, in many cases, not being delivered and yet we have the costs and inconsistencies that go with them. Consumers are concerned that they are not getting their full rights in terms of availability of products, common prices, or access to justice if they have problems in a cross-border world.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the theme of your strategy on the internal market will be that consumers and enterprises will get a better deal from the internal market and you will bring in provisions during your term of office to make sure that we really achieve that essential goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then your personal vision has expanded and been restructured; as you are also the head of the government of Europe, your goals will be jointly determined and we will also comment on these goals and their execution from a different perspective. Let me refer to your first address to us, when you made the promise that parallel processes will enhance each other in your politics. You promised a sort of Euclidean political organisational work where parallel values do not cross over and extinguish each other, although it is a great challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me refer to two examples that have been brought up several times during today’s debate. Lisbon promises a Europe of competitiveness, growth and employment. I would like to highlight my colleagues’ comments: competitiveness, growth and an increase in employment cannot conflict with the interest and value of social acceptance. It must be emphasised again and again that social acceptance represents European solidarity only if it is able to cross state boundaries and is able to create solidarity within all of the united Europe, as well as between states, in order to help weak and vulnerable countries to rise and catch up. In order for this to be achieved, complex programmes are needed that help those who fall outside our field of vision (as well as those who will not make it to the job market) and that are able to rehabilitate human resources and its environment at the same time. We need complex programmes that will make job market opportunities equal between the existing and the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The second great set of tasks is to exercise the powers of freedom <span class="italic">and</span> security as well as security <span class="italic">and</span> justice. There is no such thing as freedom <span class="italic">or</span> security, or security <span class="italic">or</span> justice. Martin Schulz indicated, and I have also heard from the mouth of a high-ranking European official, that refugees to the European Union bring with them the danger of terrorism. I hope that you reject this opinion. It is also unacceptable to regard different cultural backgrounds or Non-Christian religious views as a basis for any sort of suspicion. Specific legal measures are called for against discrimination and I am asking you to remember your promise of personal commitment and organisational work in order for the appropriate legal measures to be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A comprehensive reform of the common agricultural policy was decided on in June 2003, and this reform, which has yet to be implemented in some Member States, has brought with it profound change; it has resulted in many discussions and much insecurity and continues to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The next big step that is due will be the reform of the sugar market regime, but after that there must again be some inactivity; without that, we will not be able to offer our farmers the security to plan ahead. This must also be clearly stated in the strategic planning. Agriculture needs periods with which it can calculate, and policy must also offer a degree of certainty if it is to have any credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Financial Perspective for 2010 to 2013, Mr President of the Commission, we have to be clear in our own minds about what we want from this Europe of ours. An enlarged Europe makes a balanced cohesion and structural policy more important than ever as a means of counteracting structural differences. The forthcoming rural development has to do with the overall funding of the second pillar and hence with the maintenance of active and attractive rural areas, which cannot exist without working farmers. So it is that modulation is the source of some of the money for the second pillar. We are also concerned about our regions, their villages and towns. Europe needs clear objectives and strategies. The public also expect us to offer practical solutions to the thorny questions relating to immigration, asylum and security. When all these issues have been addressed, we will also have to budget for them. To do otherwise would be scarcely credible and will not bring us any closer to the peoples of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The impetus we are calling for from the Union is enshrined in the European Constitution and it is very encouraging that here, and in other areas, the philosophy and the budgets of the Constitution are being applied even before it is ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialists’ main contribution to the process of European integration was to introduce solidarity as one of the fundamental pillars of our project, solidarity not just as a great moral and political value, but also as a guarantee of peace, stability and prosperity for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In a manner that demonstrates considerable coherence, we have managed to update that principle in the Constitution, translating it to the reality of a globalised world. In these new circumstances, intra-European solidarity is no longer enough, at least for the Socialists.</p>
<p class="contents">We can no longer be content with a solidarity which is restricted to the territories and citizens of the Union. Rather, that solidarity must also be the European Union’s distinguishing mark on the international stage, in particular solidarity with peoples who are combating underdevelopment, for the sake of their dignity and prosperity. Our solidarity, within the new context of globalisation, must, therefore, guide the European Union’s actions in the world, but it must also be applied horizontally to all Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamental priorities for the Commission will be to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Objectives, with particular emphasis on the eradication of poverty and hunger, taking action both in the least-developed countries and in the least-favoured pockets of population in the more developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating AIDS and other diseases linked to poverty and underdevelopment, such as malaria and tuberculosis, must also be our priorities, as well as the promotion of women in the countries with which we cooperate with a view to ensuring their development and dialogue between civilisations, implemented by the President of the Spanish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this field, the Commission will have a great responsibility in terms of promoting and coordinating its action with that of the Member States of the Union, with a view to ensuring complementarity and consistency, particularly in terms of our presence and influence in the development agencies of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve all of this, it will be essential to maintain, and even to increase, the funding of our development and humanitarian action policies, fulfilling the commitments and the timetable we established in Barcelona and Monterrey, and not simply be content with that, but set increasingly ambitious goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of important issues have coincided; I refer to the preliminary assessment of the most recent enlargement, preparations for subsequent enlargements, including the complex debate on Turkish membership, the initial assessment of actions ensuing from the Lisbon strategy, and preparatory work for the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission will have to decide on the strategic actions it considers most important with a view to achieving the both the aims laid down in the Treaties and those thrust upon us by current circumstances in the Union and neighbouring areas. This is an issue of great importance for the European Parliament and also for national parliaments. Clearly, Member States are at different levels of economic development. In the interests of all Members of the Union it is therefore essential to take all necessary action to reduce such differences, which will facilitate development of the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years now, an active cohesion policy has been instrumental in the reduction of development differences, and has been accompanied by deepening economic integration and the entry of new Member States, which are rated relatively poorly in terms of development indicators. This situation emphasises the appropriateness and validity of the provisions of the Treaties, in which it is laid down that one of the Union’s key aims is attaining social and economic cohesion. It is also recognised in the Treaties that cohesion policy is one of the Union’s main policies. In addition, cohesion policy is not perceived as a short-term policy in response to the current situation, but a permanent and inviolable feature of Community action. All the experience gained to date indicates that cohesion policy is as important as ever, and this has been confirmed by successive Commission reports. It is also apparent that, although cohesion policy requires significant financial resources, what it requires above all else is for those charged with implementing policies to show the necessary will and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, and speaking also on behalf of many Members of this House, I should like to say that we are confident the new Commission will live up to expectations. We trust it will not start from the false premise that it needs to choose between cohesion policy and growth policy.</p>

They are the European economic and social model which we advocate, and developing the area of freedom, security and justice. For all this to be achieved, principles of sustainable development need to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Lisbon strategy, however, competitiveness cannot come about if the Member States do not start to implement decisions effectively. Within the Union a sort of non-solidarity movement has developed, led by those countries that are slow to implement decisions. This is conspicuous, for example, in the telecommunications and energy sectors. The Commission should intervene here swiftly, as it is costing us billions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is sustainable development? Is it environmental, social or intellectual development? It is obviously all of these, but particularly intellectual. If the basic education system of our countries fails, there will not be sustainable development. In my own country, 15% of teenage boys have dropped out of school. The link between school and home is no longer viable, despite the fact that for years my country has been the best in the whole world in the field of basic education.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we doing in Europe? The result will be a Europe of ageing and poorly educated people. What sort of sustainable development is that? We have to invest in research and product development. A 3% ceiling is unachievable, except in two countries. Take a look at all the statistics. The countries that have achieved this top all the available statistics. That gives us a good example of what should be done. This is the century of revolution within the fields of information and technology. Since the mid-1990s, 40% of our competitiveness has been based on new technology, and in the United States the figure is 60%. We can only gain from this. I would urge Mr Barroso and the Commission to take advantage of this; otherwise we will be trampled on by others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that our great task in the aftermath of 1 May 2004 is to stabilise the process of European integration. We must not overstretch ourselves by now accepting too many new Member States into the European Union; instead, we must join together with our ten new Member States in consolidating what we have achieved, for they want this and are willing to actively contribute to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to make the European Union more competitive, and there is much that has to take second place to that. Let me take this opportunity to put the very straightforward question – and I am glad that the Vice-President is here – as to whether it makes sense to use the REACH project to enhance the competitiveness of industries outside the European Union, while ushering in a programme of deindustrialisation at home? I would like to back up Mrs Schierhuber in what she said about the sugar market regime. Is there any sense in our allowing into the European Union sugar produced in Brazil with disregard for the environment and for human life, while at the same time making life difficult for our countryside with more and more impositions? Does that make the European Union more competitive? Such are the questions that the Commission will have to answer over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is this. We need to create confidence in the euro. This is something we can do together. People have followed this single currency project with no more than a critical eye. Our task must be to create the favourable prospects that this young currency deserves. In practical terms, that means that the Stability Pact must not, of course, be called into question, nor must it be subject to intelligent interpretation; instead, Europe will not be able to produce a lasting solution to the problems of a constantly ageing population and the diminishing options for the young unless all the Member States find a way out of the debt trap. In doing that, the Stability Pact has a highly disciplinary effect; it must not be abandoned, but defended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an excellent paper and I commend it to you, Mr Barroso. Its priority is your priority: to make Europe more competitive and prosperous. It recognises that this can only be done by economic reform and, as part of the reform programme, it calls upon the Commission to offer stronger leadership to make labour markets more flexible. This does not mean that the Commission should lead only individual Member States towards the promised land, it should also lead each individual Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">What particularly worried me during the previous mandate was the way that certain Commissioners ran their own individual empires. For example, in the area of my particular interest, employment and social affairs, I waited in vain for the Commission to act as a college and for Mr Prodi to highlight the way that certain social directives were hampering competitiveness and holding back employment. However, this seemed to be a no-go area for the Commission as a whole, as if to say that, if it dared to challenge proposed social legislation, this might signify that it did not care about social justice and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">We all believe intensely in the importance of social justice and social cohesion, but the greatest social injustice is unemployment: one of the greatest sources of social exclusion is unemployment. Mr Schulz talked earlier of workers' rights, and of course these are important, but we must also pay attention to non-workers' rights, the rights of those who are willing and eager to work but have no job. That is why the Commission as a whole must have the courage to revisit and rebalance the social agenda and to promote employment as a priority, with flexibility in labour markets as the guiding star. Mr Barroso, you will not succeed unless you do this. Europe will not succeed unless you do this. You must succeed and we wish you well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The changes have come about because of the accession of ten new Member States and because of the new eastern border. This House believes you have every intention of fulfilling the incoming Commission’s historic mission. Nonetheless, if the Commission’s actions are characterised by inertia, and if its strategic political approach fails to take these two new parameters into account, the mission will not be accomplished, Mr President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This mission consists of bringing together a Europe torn asunder at Yalta. It involves creating a new eastern dimension for the European Union. The first objective has to be the reunification of Europe, and ensuring that theoretical enlargement is consolidated through greater cohesion and economic solidarity should be one of the main and ongoing objectives of the Barroso Commission. It must be an objective in its own right, and not secondary to the Lisbon strategy and subsumed within it. In addition, good governance of the new Union calls for cohesion to be achieved by levelling out differences in economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">According to your statement to the House, Mr Barroso, one cannot have more Europe for less money. You must therefore stand firm against the selfish attitudes of net contributors and of those Member States no longer eligible for cohesion funding following their economic success. The new Constitution requires greater political solidarity, and it is impossible to ensure credible consolidation of the Union on the basis of this new Constitution whilst simultaneously refusing or indeed reducing economic solidarity. Such a policy would be inconsistent and therefore ineffective. I appeal to you, Mr Barroso, to defend the original budget proposal put forward by the Commission. I urge you to hold an in-depth discussion with Commissioner Grybauskaitė. As we understand it, in Parliament she adopted a position contrary to yours.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective must be the new eastern dimension. The Union is a community of values, and we ought to be delighted that these values are spreading beyond our borders. We should be exporting democracy and human rights. On the one hand, the Commission’s eastern policy should be firmer, more demanding and speedier, and on the other, it should be more open and generous to fledgling democracies. It needs to be a diverse policy, and one that imposes conditions. It should encourage democratic choice, as in Ukraine. Ukraine needs action, not merely words. Its European aspirations should be welcomed, and it should be offered something more than the old action plan prepared before the great democratic transformation. It should be offered an Association Agreement. The new eastern policy calls for new instruments. The Union is in danger of allowing itself to be led by old objectives. New challenges call for new approaches. We trust you will foster the latter, Mr Barroso. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has to be the Europe of freedom, and freedom only exists in a healthy economic environment, where there is real and effective security. We need a competitive economy to meet the challenges of growth and full employment within a context of globalisation, the benefits of which we must learn how to harness.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge we face is that of achieving an economy that makes use of natural resources in a balanced way and that is efficient because it is modern, and not because it accepts any breach of the commitments on which the essence of its social model is based. Wealth cannot be produced without work, and more wealth cannot be produced by working less. There is no such miracle, and those who persist in conjuring up that mirage will be responsible for less development and less cohesion on both the economic and the social fronts.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we need security. Not the security of talk that exploits people’s fears or that ignores the threats, but the kind resulting from firm policies that guarantee effective borders and internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe also needs to share with our traditional allies an international policy that promotes democracy and peace in our neighbouring countries and which contributes to a safer and more developed world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the coming years will require Mr Barroso’s Commission to display competence and to chart a firm course during a period marked by uncertainties arising from the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty and the financial constraints imposed on the Member States by the Stability and Growth Pact. We cannot have a Union with more competences, more policies, more obligations and more Member States on the one hand, and a smaller budget and fewer resources on the other. It is an impossible equation, which, in the long term, will prevent us from achieving what we all want: a free, developed economy on safe territory. That is truly the key to our model and to the political orientations on which it must be based over the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are witnessing increased international commercial interdependence and integration of the markets. We are also witnessing a constant increase in the number of States participating in the multilateral cooperation system. These are both good reasons for adjusting the rules and disciplines of the WTO, for further opening the markets in goods and services and for forging a stronger link between international trade and development. This trend clearly colours the Doha agenda. However, progress with negotiations to date demonstrates that there are difficulties. The European Union, the most important factor in the international economy and commercial diplomacy, is being called on to take on an even more active – I would say leading – role in strengthening and constantly adjusting the WTO system.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the new globalised environment to be able to optimise the distribution of resources, stability, predictability and solidarity, it will need to be reinforced with new, strong administrative institutions and mechanisms. Only thus will repercussions be avoided such as, for example, the textile and clothing industry and the sugar regime.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal concerns the fields of economic and political cooperation between the financial markets and international development cooperation on the basis of a standard for a new, international, social and ecological market economy. Today's world needs a new, cohesive global economic order, a new system of mutually supportive institutional and operational arrangements. I believe that this is the direction in which Europe should move and in which the Commission – I am addressing you, Mr President of the Commission – is being called on to develop creative initiatives and actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President of the Commission, you have announced that you and your Commission will be prioritising the socio-economic dimension of your policy, and it goes without saying that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports this. We all know that there is some catching up to be done in the Lisbon process, and we are delighted to hear that you want to put the train to Lisbon on a fast track.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with Mr Kok, we would urge you to be more focused and to coordinate the Lisbon process more effectively, as regards both the internal objectives and others, including the guidelines for employment, the global economic guidelines and the macro-economic dialogue. We want to complete the Lisbon process, because we consider it imperative to be able to live in a social market economy in future, where efficiency goes hand in hand with justice and own responsibility goes hand in hand with solidarity. We are acutely aware that you cannot have one without the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to table concrete proposals in order to bring pressure to bear on the Member States and their regions, so that they can do their share of the work in the areas of education, training, and investments in scientific research, but also in structural reforms. Possible aids could be national Lisbon plans, a number of structural indicators, involving national parliaments in monitoring and assessing the process and certainly also a classification of the Member States according to performance.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we would also urge you to ensure that the essence of the Stability and Growth Pact remains intact. That is something about which a number of Members have had a lot to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would ask you to help us to bring about the internal market in services, but in the right way, that is, with the support of the public and of civil society. We are also expecting proposals aimed at improving the investment climate, including for the medium-sized and small enterprises that are still the driving force of our economic growth. We all know that without any growth, there are no jobs, and without any jobs, there is no basis for social security, which we are all very keen to see protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you have an arduous task, all the more so because the Constitution has not yet been approved and the financial perspectives are as yet unknown. We are, in fact, asking you to serve up a menu without having a kitchen to prepare it and without knowing what budget is available. However, we are counting on your creativity and on a good team spirit among your people. If, in January, you propose solid policy and dish up a consistent meal, you will have a lasting ally in the PPE-DE Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank you for your contributions, which reflect a wide variety of views in this Parliament. I also eagerly await the result of your vote next Thursday. The resolution that is then adopted will certainly be very important for the common strategic vision that we want for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time I think I might already draw three provisional conclusions. First, I note that the great majority of speakers agree with the need to define priorities that correspond to the public’s expectations and think it important that the European Union and its institutions should respond to the primary concerns of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the great majority of speakers identified three basic areas for action: the area we can call Lisbon, the Lisbon strategy (economic reform with a social and environmental dimension); the areas connected with security and justice; and Europe’s role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I also see that there is broad consensus on the need for a proactive cohesion policy, a true solidarity policy in Europe. I particularly hope that the Member States’ Governments have taken careful note of this. Accordingly, I feel that we can conclude that there is consensus regarding Europe’s need for growth and employment. Without growth, without job creation and without greater dynamism in our economy, we shall be unable to maintain the high levels of social protection and the exacting environmental standards that we regard as part of what is normally called the European model.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake is not, and never has been, the destruction of the European model. What is truly at stake is the need to adapt and to modernise this European model, and to take account of a number of new challenges that are now making themselves felt across Europe and the world. The increasing age of our population, the effects of globalisation – all this requires Europe to adapt and change within this more competitive context. I am pleased to say that I do not believe that concerns for economic efficiency and concerns for social justice are mutually incompatible. These objectives – greater competitiveness alongside sustainable development and social concern – cannot in any way be incompatible. We have to work to make them compatible. These are objectives that define one of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe we must work towards achieving the broadest possible consensus, but a dynamic consensus and one that is not the result of cancelling out opposing points of view, because we also have to recognise that there are some contradictory priorities here in Parliament. Accordingly, we have to identify the highest common denominator for a dynamic consensus. I think that one consensus that has clearly emerged is the need to strengthen our solidarity at this time when we have an enlarged Europe. We have a Europe in the process of reunification. Our enlargement is an enlargement that has only just begun. We have signed the treaties and have ten new Member States among us, but we have to do all we can so that we can soon stop talking about old and new Member States and become a real Union, and for that we need an active cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I keep returning to the idea of a plan of values, and solidarity is certainly a value that can unite us. That is why I say that now, when I see the issue of European identity being debated so often in Europe, I have to stress that it is rooted in respect for our various national, regional and local identities. European diversity is what truly defines our identity and, if we want to define identity, we must define it in terms of the values enshrined in the European Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is, respect for the dignity of the human being, for human rights, for justice, for the rule of law and for the principles of freedom and equality. These are the values that define our identity. Respect for the principle of non-discrimination and tolerance towards anyone who comes in through our borders. It is therefore on the basis of these values that we can promote the idea of Europe around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I said in my first speech that it is on the basis of these values that we can best look after our interests. We are looking after our interests with a more ambitious neighbourhood policy: a policy for our Eastern or Mediterranean neighbours that promotes stability and peace, as we have been doing in Ukraine, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline something that has not always been put into words. The signals that the European Union has sent out during the current crisis in Ukraine have been highly positive. Without any competition for the limelight, we have had the Council Presidency, the European Council, the European Commission and some Member States all involved in seeking a peaceful, democratic solution for Ukraine. That reflects very well on our Europe. We must also, however, have a generous development policy. As I have already said, Europe cannot be selfish. The policy must reflect externally what we now do internally, having overcome a great many historical conflicts by means of collaboration between Member States that were very often at war with each other in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe we have the duty to advocate effective multilateralism, whereby we work on a platform of equality and respect with our principal partners, we seek to revitalise the transatlantic alliance, and unite all our partners around values such as freedom, peace and democracy. That is how Europe progresses – by enriching its heritage, by building and renewing a dynamic consensus and by seeking to show the world those qualities that make it so different.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish, ladies and gentlemen, by assuring you that the Commission will seek to take account of Parliament’s positions, so as to incorporate those positions into what we hope will be a strategic vision not just for one institution or another, but a strategic vision for all European institutions and for the European Union as a whole throughout the next five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
